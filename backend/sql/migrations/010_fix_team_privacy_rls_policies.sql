-- ========================================
-- FIX TEAM PRIVACY RLS POLICIES
-- Remove admin bypass for team content to enforce team privacy
-- ========================================
-- This migration fixes a security issue where system admins could see
-- all team folders and documents even if they weren't team members.
--
-- After this migration:
-- - System admins can see user documents and global documents
-- - System admins CANNOT see team documents unless they're team members
-- - Team privacy is enforced for all users, including system admins
--
-- Usage:
-- docker exec -i <postgres-container> psql -U postgres -d bastion_knowledge_base < backend/sql/migrations/010_fix_team_privacy_rls_policies.sql
-- ========================================

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS document_metadata_select_policy ON document_metadata;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS document_metadata_update_policy ON document_metadata;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS document_folders_select_policy ON document_folders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS document_folders_update_policy ON document_folders;
