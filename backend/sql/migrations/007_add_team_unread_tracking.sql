-- ========================================
-- TEAM UNREAD POST TRACKING MIGRATION
-- Adds unread post tracking and muting support
-- ========================================
-- This migration can be run on existing databases without data loss
-- Idempotent design - safe to run multiple times

-- Add last_read_at and muted fields to team_members

    -- Add last_read_at column if it doesn't exist
