-- FIX TEAMS RLS POLICIES
-- Add missing INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE policies for teams system
-- ========================================
-- This migration fixes the RLS policy gap that prevents team creation,
-- posting, commenting, and other team operations.
--
-- Usage:
-- docker exec -i <postgres-container> psql -U bastion_user -d bastion_knowledge_base < backend/sql/migrations/009_fix_teams_rls_policies.sql
-- Or from within container:
-- psql -U bastion_user -d bastion_knowledge_base -f /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/migrations/009_fix_teams_rls_policies.sql
-- ========================================

-- Drop existing policies if they exist (idempotent)
