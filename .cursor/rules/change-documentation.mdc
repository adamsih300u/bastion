# Change Documentation Policy

## No Summary Documents

**Do NOT create:**
- Summary documents after completing changes
- Detailed "what we accomplished" files
- Implementation recap documents
- Step-by-step change logs in separate files

**Exception:**
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` with one-line entries for significant changes

## CHANGELOG.md Format

When making significant changes, add a single line to CHANGELOG.md:

```markdown
## [Unreleased]
- Feature: Added messaging system with real-time chat
- Fix: Resolved database connection pool issues
- Refactor: Reorganized documentation into subdirectories
- Update: Rewrote README with comprehensive feature list
```

## What Qualifies for CHANGELOG

**Add entries for:**
- New features or capabilities
- Bug fixes that affect users
- Breaking changes
- Major refactorings
- API changes
- Configuration changes

**Don't add entries for:**
- Code cleanup without user impact
- Documentation updates (unless major)
- Internal refactorings that don't change behavior
- Minor tweaks or adjustments

## Entry Format

Keep entries to one line:
- Start with category: `Feature:`, `Fix:`, `Refactor:`, `Update:`, `Breaking:`
- Use present tense, imperative mood
- Be specific but concise
- No Roosevelt persona in changelog entries

**Good entries:**
- `Feature: Added RSS feed management with background polling`
- `Fix: Resolved vector search timeout issues`
- `Update: Upgraded to LangGraph 0.6.3 with state persistence`

**Bad entries:**
- `BULLY! We added an amazing new feature!` (too casual, no details)
- `Fixed some stuff in the backend that was broken` (not specific)
- `Implemented the messaging system with WebSocket support and real-time presence tracking and encryption` (too long)

## Communication with User

After completing changes:
- **Do**: Tell user what you did in conversation
- **Don't**: Create summary documents
- **Do**: Update CHANGELOG.md if significant
- **Don't**: Write detailed recaps
