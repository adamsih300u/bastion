description: Prohibition of Rooseveltian language in code and technical content
---

# No Roosevelt Language in Code

## Strict Prohibition

**ABSOLUTELY NO Roosevelt persona in:**
- Source code (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, etc.)
- Log statements (logger.info, console.log, etc.)
- Code comments and docstrings
- Variable/function/class names
- Error messages
- Debug output
- Technical documentation files

## Banned Phrases in Code

**Never use in code:**
- BULLY!
- By George!
- Roosevelt
- cavalry
- Rough Riders
- trust busting / trust-busting
- Square Deal
- charge forward / charging forward
- Big Stick
- mounted and ready
- saddled and ready

## Professional Alternatives

### Logging Statements

```python
# ❌ WRONG
logger.info("🏇 BULLY! Messaging service initialized!")
logger.info("🔍 ROOSEVELT: Searching for documents")
logger.info("⚡ By George! Processing complete!")

# ✅ CORRECT
logger.info("Messaging service initialized")
logger.info("Searching for documents")
logger.info("Processing complete")
```

### Comments

```python
# ❌ WRONG
# BULLY! This function charges forward with data processing
# Roosevelt's trust-busting connection manager
# By George! This is a well-organized cavalry charge

# ✅ CORRECT
# Process incoming data and return validated results
# Centralized database connection manager
# Efficient parallel processing implementation
```

### Console Logging (Frontend)

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
console.log('🏇 ROOSEVELT: Loading conversation from localStorage');
console.log('💬 BULLY! Connected to room');
console.log('📦 ROOSEVELT: Archiving entry');

// ✅ CORRECT
console.log('Loading conversation from localStorage');
console.log('Connected to room');
console.log('Archiving entry');
```

### Function/Class Names

```python
# ❌ WRONG
def roosevelt_trust_bust_connection():
    pass

class RoughRiderService:
    pass

# ✅ CORRECT
def cleanup_connections():
    pass

class ConnectionService:
    pass
```

## Emoji Usage in Logs

**Keep emojis for visual categorization, remove Roosevelt language:**

```python
# ✅ GOOD - Emoji for category, professional text
logger.info("🔍 Searching documents")
logger.info("✅ Service initialized")  
logger.info("❌ Failed to process request")
logger.info("🔄 Reloading configuration")

# ❌ BAD - Emoji + Roosevelt language
logger.info("🏇 BULLY! Charging forward!")
logger.info("🎯 ROOSEVELT: Starting process")
```

## Quick Cleanup Patterns

When cleaning up existing code, replace:

1. `BULLY!` → (remove entirely, keep rest of message)
2. `ROOSEVELT:` → (remove entirely, keep rest of message)
3. `By George!` → (remove entirely)
4. `cavalry charge` → `operation` or `process`
5. `charging forward` → `processing` or `starting`
6. `mounted and ready` → `initialized` or `ready`
7. `saddled and ready` → `initialized` or `ready`
8. `trust busting` → `cleanup` or `optimization`

## Why This Matters

1. **Professionalism**: Logs may be viewed by clients, stakeholders, or other developers
2. **Searchability**: Technical terms are easier to search than personality phrases
3. **Internationalization**: Roosevelt references don't translate well
4. **Clarity**: Professional language is clearer and more direct
5. **Maintenance**: Future developers expect standard technical language

## Exception

Roosevelt persona IS allowed in:
- Conversations with the user (agent responses)
- Cursor rule files (for instructing the agent)
- Historical documentation in `docs/historical_summaries/`

Roosevelt persona is NOT allowed in:
- Any production code files
- Any log statements
- Any comments or docstrings
- Any technical documentation

## Agent Behavior

When writing new code:
- Use professional, clear technical language
- Keep emojis for categorization (optional)
- Remove all Roosevelt references
- Write logs that could appear in production systems

When updating existing code:
- Clean up Roosevelt language when you touch a file
- Don't need to clean entire codebase at once
- Focus on files you're actively modifying
