A Wave of Charlie Kirk Tributes Is Spreing Across South Korea | The Gateway Pundit | by Jim Hoft From our trusted source in South Korea: I would to with you an important development in South Korea ing the tragic death of Charlie Kirk. His passing has not only shaken America, but it has also deeply touched the hearts of freedom-loving citizens here. What began as grief has quickly become a wave of tributes spreing across our nation. Young Conservative Generation Vows to Honor His Legacy Forever The sudden death of Charlie Kirk, a symbol of the American conservative movement and a fighter for freedom, has delivered a deep shock to Korea’s freedom movement as well. Yet this tragic news has not ended in sorrow alone—it has sparked a powerful wave of tributes across the nation. In Seoul and other major cities, churches, youth groups, conservative parties, and students from Freedom University have led memorial services, prayer gatherings, and tribute marches. With the Korean and American flags raised together, moments of floral tributes and silent prayers have become a symbolic expression of the strong bond of the Korea-U.S. freedom alliance. Above all, this wave of remembrance is significant because it is being carried nationwide, led primarily by the younger generation. Just a week before his passing, Charlie Kirk visited Korea and left young people here with great hope and courage. His speech and message are now regarded as a kind of final testament, and Korea’s freedom movement remembers it as the “Five Commitments to Be Upheld to the End.” — The Five Commitments Left by Charlie Kirk 1. Keep Korea’s streets clean and preserve their beauty. 2. Korea grew with the help of America, but has alrey repaid that debt many times. One of America’s greatest achievements is Korea itself. 3. Stand with America in the fight for freedom, and never bow to the Chinese Communist Party. 4. Do not yield to illegal immigration policies. Koreans should, if possible, raise more children and safeguard the nation’s population. 5. As long as Koreans fight for freedom, America too will rise to stand for justice. These five messages are not merely vice—they are being embraced as a d legacy that the freedom movements of Korea and America must uphold together. — “His Legacy Will Live On Forever” Korea’s young conservatives have me it clear that these memorial events will not end as a one-time gesture. They declared, “To ensure that Charlie Kirk’s commitments and legacy are never forgotten, we will continue to hold large-scale tribute marches and rallies.” The remembrance is evolving beyond memory into tangible action and practice by Korea’s youth. Patriots of Korea’s freedom movement also emphasized through this moment, “We in America’s grief.” Korea fought alongside the United States during the Korean War to defend freedom, and even today the alliance remains the foundation of national security. Young Koreans do not see Charlie Kirk’s death as America’s loss alone, but as a pain borne by the entire free world. They have pledged to carry the banner he left behind. — The Ro Ahe Across Korea, ditional large-scale tribute marches and gatherings are alrey being prepared. Conservative parties, Freedom University, and youth organizations are uniting to commemorate Charlie Kirk and to spre his message around the world. They declare, “Charlie Kirk’s spirit lives on in the hearts of young people in both Korea and the United States.” His name and legacy will continue to shine as a beacon of freedom. — Photos and Videos: Tribute Gathering 1: Tribute Gathering 2: Tribute Gathering 3: Photos and videos taken in Seoul and across the provinces demonstrate how Korea is sharing in America’s grief and strengthening the solidarity of the free world. — Charlie Kirk’s death is not the end. It has become a new signal of departure for the youth of the freedom movements in both Korea and the United States, and his name will never be forgotten. I respectfully ask that you highlight this story—so the world knows that South Korea is also mourning together with America, and that his legacy is living on here as well.
