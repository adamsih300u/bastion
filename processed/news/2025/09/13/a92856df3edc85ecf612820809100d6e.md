Rical Mayoral Candidate Receiving Big Money From Leftists Outside of NYC | The Gateway Pundit | by Margaret Flavin According to The New York Post, socialist NYC mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is raking in funds from leftists outside of the City who will not have to deal with, or suffer from, the rical agenda he hopes to enact. From The New York Post: Deep-pocketed, out-of-state donors account for 78% of the nearly $2.4 million raised by a super PAC backing Zohran Mamdani’s NYC mayoral campaign . Lefties outside the Empire State wrote fat checks totaling $1,831,706 to the group, New Yorkers for Lower Costs, as of Friday, records showed. The sum included $762,631 from 26 California donors, with most of it coming from just two people. Mayor Eric ams’ campaign spokesman, Todd Shapiro, noted, “Mamdani’s campaign isn’t about New York City — it’s about fueling a national socialist movement bankrolled by donors in California and beyond … with Hollywood and out-of-state activists trying to dictate the future of our city.” Mamdani’s rical plans include transforming the city by hiking property taxes for “ richer and whiter neighborhoods.’ He has also waged a longstanding campaign aimed at defunding the New York Police Department , which he claims is designed to “control black, brown and poor New Yorkers.” The Gateway Pundit reported on another method of delivering funds to his campaign via potentially illegal tax-exempt charity-funded operations are being funnelled to Mamdani, disguised as community activism. In his July 2025 article, How Elite Money Flows Through Working Families Party Network , forensic investigator Sam Antar exposes a hidden financial web he calls “grassroots laundering” with Mamdani’s rise as a case study.
