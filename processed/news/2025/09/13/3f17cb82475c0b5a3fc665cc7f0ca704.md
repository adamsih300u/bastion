Victor Reacts: Charlie Kirk Was a Good Man. Thousands of Liberals Are Celebrating His Death Because He H Different Opinions Than They Did (VIDEO) | The Gateway Pundit | by Victor Nieves Charlie was a good man, and a moderate politically, who h deep love for his country, family, and God. He just wanted to talk with those who disagreed with him and they brutally murdered him for it. He was a hero to myself and countless other young Americans. He did more than just about anyone to change the hearts and minds of a generation who so desperately needed it. Now there are thousands on the left celebrating the brutal murder of a good man simply because he h different opinions than they did. A family man. A man of faith. This must end. The Gateway Pundit reported , After Charlie Kirk’s death was announced, a man named Jeremiah Farmer , a transportation driver at Orgill Inc. in Utah, who lists LGBTQ and pronouns in his bio, posted: “We need to find people with better aim.” Clark Kennedy of Queens, New York, d a photo of Kirk slumped in his chair after being hit in the neck by an assassin’s bullet with the , “Bro got a kill cam and everything.” In a separate post, he repeated the phrase “Please be de, please be de, please be de” over and over. Miles Carter-Washington, who works at Boeing Space, Defense, and Intelligence Systems — US Department of War wrote “He got what he deserved.” These are the kinds of posts being documented at a website dedicated to exposing such reactions: https://www.charliesmurderers.com/ . It compiles public s from both well-known figures and ordinary users who are reveling in his death. They hated Charlie Kirk because he spoke the truth and was an outspoken Christian. The left, including media and public figures , revealed their true colors through horrific s about his assassination. Since this information is public, reposting it is not doxxing. The website documenting these posts describes itself as “a lawful data aggregator of publicly available information” created to expose those glorifying political violence. It states: “We firmly denounce all political violence and criminal activity. You cannot call someone a nazi, fascist, enemy of the state, etc. for years, even after the attempt on Trump’s life, without something this happening. Every single Democrat in the country needs to do some real soul ing and ask themselves if this is what they want to align themselves with. Something has to change and it has to change quickly. This direction is not one that anyone wants to go.
