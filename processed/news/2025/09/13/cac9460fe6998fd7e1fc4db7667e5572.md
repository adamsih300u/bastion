President Trump Confirms he Will Attend Charlie Kirk’s Funeral in Arizona: “I Have an Obligation… I’ll be There” (VIDEO) The President ly released a powerful video statement on Wednesday , remembering the life of Charlie Kirk and condemning the wave of “rical left political violence” in America. "Charlie was a patriot who devoted his life to the cause of open debate and the country that he loved so much—the United States of America," Trump said, describing the day of his death as a "dark moment for America." He ded, "Charlie was also a man of deep, deep faith. And we take comfort in the knowledge that he is now at peace with God in heaven." He further announced on Thursday that he will award Charlie a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom, calling him “a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty and an inspiration to millions and millions of people.” Turning Point USA published the ing eulogy for Charlie on the event webpage . Charlie Kirk’s life was a testament to faith, courage, and conviction. From his earliest days, he believed America was worth fighting for, and he dedicated every moment of his 31 years to that cause. He lived with eyes fixed on eternity, grounded in the truth of God’s Word, and driven by a calling bigger than himself. Charlie was a servant of the Lord, a devoted husband to Erika, a loving father to two beautiful children, and a leer of uncommon clarity and strength. He did not seek influence for its own sake. Inste, he poured his life into others, raising up a generation who would be bold in their faith, stefast in their love of freedom, and unafraid to defend their country. What began as the vision of an 18-year-old in a small garage in Lemont, Illinois, grew into one of the most powerful grassroots movements in America. Through Turning Point USA, Charlie ignited a fire in the hearts of tens of millions daily. He showed a generation that truth must never be silenced, that courage is contagious, and that freedom must be protected at all costs. Charlie died doing what he loved: fighting for truth, for faith, for family, and for America. His sacrifice will endure as a guiding light for generations. Though our hearts are heavy, we do not grieve as those without hope. Charlie’s legacy endures in his family, in Turning Point USA and Turning Point Action, and in the millions he inspired to live with conviction. We honor him not only with our words, but with our actions. We will move forward together, fighting harder, standing taller, and refusing to surrender. Charlie’s life was short, but it was full. It was defined by truth, anchored in faith, and devoted to the country he loved. His legacy will endure for generations. And now he hears the words of Matthew 25:23 from his Lord and Savior: “Well done, good and faithful servant.” Charlie Kirk was murdered by a leftwing terrorist, later discovered to be 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, on Wednesday, September 10, during a "Prove Me Wrong" event at Utah Valley University. Two young children and his widow, Erika, were robbed of a father and husband. Erika Kirk dressed the nation for the first time since Charlie's assassination on Friday, where she vowed to continue the mission of Turning Point USA and "never surrender." “One of Charlie’s favorite Bible verses was Ephesians 5 verse 25: Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her,” she cried. “My husband laid down his life for me, for our nation, for our children.” In a tribute to Charlie, Erika kneeled before his open casket on Friday , writing on Instagram, "They have no idea what they just ignited within this wife. If they thought my husband’s mission was big now..you have no idea. I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, God bless you,” Erika can be heard in a video, whispering to her husband as she wept over his body. Across the nation and the world, Americans and others abro have also gathered in prayer for our Brother in Christ, Charlie, and his loving family. Outside Turning Point USA's hequarters in Chandler, Arizona, there has been a "constant flow of thousands of people," paying their respects and saying prayers. The constant flow of thousands of people at our hequarters and the first building we ever h is extremely uplifting.
