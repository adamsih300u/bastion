MSNBC Analyst Fired Over Vile Charlie Kirk Rant Says He is in ‘Shell Shock’ - Then Blames His Termination on ‘Right-Wing Mob’ | The Gateway Pundit | by Ben Kew The fired MSNBC analyst Matthew Dowd is speaking out after he was terminated by the network for his s on the death of Charlie Kirk. In a post on Friday, Dowd mitted he was in “shellshock” over his firing and blamed it on a “right-wing mob.” He wrote on his Substack : I said that Kirk has been a very divisive and polarizing figure. I then ded that we are in a toxic time in America, un every other democracy in the world, where we have a combination of divisiveness and near unlimited access to guns. The effort by Holocaust survivors to remind folks of Germany in the 1930s #ItStartedWithWords came to my mind and I said my now legendary line “hateful thoughts le to hateful words which ultimately le to hateful actions”. I thought to myself how could anyone disagree with this. I guess I was naive. The Right Wing media mob ginned up, went after me on a plethora of platforms, and MSNBC reacted to that mob. Even though most at MSNBC knew my words were being misconstrued, the timing of my words forgotten (remember I said this before anyone knew Kirk was a target), and that I apologized for any miscommunication on my part, I was terminated by the end of the day. I am getting over the shell shock of the past few days, and will turn my gaze on ventures and the journey ahe. Dowd, who is a former Bush Republican turned Never Trumper, was fired after going on a rant about Kirk’s supposed hate speech and suggested his death may have been a supporter shooting a gun in celebration. “He’s been one of the most divisive, especially divisive younger figures in this, who is constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech, or sort of aimed at certain groups,” Dowd remarked. ”And I always go back to, hateful thoughts le to hateful words, which then le to hateful actions.” “We don’t know the full details of this,” Dowd said. “We don’t know if this was a supporter shooting their gun off in celebration. So, we have no idea.” Meanwhile, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts has warned all MSNBC employees to start behaving themselves in the wake of Kirk’s brutal assassination. “You may have seen that MSNBC recently ended its association with a contributor who me an unacceptable and insensitive about this horrific event,” he wrote in a company wide memo. “That coverage was at odds with fostering civil dialogue and being willing to listen to the points of view of those who have differing opinions.” Comcast CEO Warns MSNBC Staff to Behave After Firing Analyst Over Vile Charlie Kirk Rant: ‘We Need to Do Better’
