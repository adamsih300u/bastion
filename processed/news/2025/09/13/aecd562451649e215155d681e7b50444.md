An ICE officer was hospitalized after being intentionally struck and dragged with a car by an illegal alien during an arrest attempt.

An Illegal Dragged an ICE Agent with HIS Car, Now He’s De and Liberals Are Angry | The Gateway Pundit | by Antonio Graceffo An ICE officer was hospitalized after being intentionally struck and dragged with a car by an illegal alien during an arrest attempt. The officer fired in self-defense, and the man is now de. Inste of blaming the criminal who caused this, liberals are furious, demanding a full investigation and accusing President Trump and ICE of creating chaos. On the morning of September 12, 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers attempted to arrest 38-year-old illegal alien Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez during a vehicle stop. He resisted, ignored commands, and drove his car directly at the officers. One officer was struck and dragged “a significant distance” as Villegas-Gonzalez tried to flee. Fearing for his life, the officer discharged his weapon, fatally shooting Villegas-Gonzalez. Both men received immediate medical attention and were transported to a local hospital. Villegas-Gonzalez was later pronounced de, while the ICE officer sustained serious but stable injuries. Villegas-Gonzalez was an undocumented immigrant from the Mexican state of Michoacán who h been living in the United States illegally for over 20 years. According to the Department of Homeland Security, he h a prior reckless driving conviction. Mainstream media highlighted that the “Michigan man,” Villegas-Gonzalez, was described by his girlfriend and stepdaughter as “a fun guy” who “respected people.” But he was not a “Michigan man.” He was an illegal alien from cartel stronghold Michoacán, Mexico, home to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and La Nueva Familia Michoacana (LNFM). And being a “fun guy” is not a defense in federal court. What the media downplays is that he lived in the United States illegally for deces, h prior convictions, and attempted to kill an officer with his car. The shooting occurred amid “Operation Midway Blitz,” a heightened ICE enforcement campaign in the Chicago area involving around 300 agents. The incident drew heavy law enforcement presence, ro closures, and sparked immediate community protests and political condemnation from immigrant rights groups and local officials, including Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who called for a transparent investigation and questioned whether there was a warrant for Villegas-Gonzalez’s detention, noting “He h just dropped off two children at a local school.” Once again, the usual suspects are grasping at straws to defend the criminal and vilify law enforcement. Traffic stops generally do not require warrants under the vehicle exception to the Fourth Amendment, and ICE is authorized to conduct stops based on reasonable suspicion of immigration violations without a warrant in many circumstances. As for the claim that he h “just dropped his kids off at school,” there is no federal or state statute that grants immunity from arrest simply because someone is transporting children. Moreover, illegal aliens typically do not pay federal income taxes, meaning his children’s education was being funded by U.S. taxpayers. Liberals often argue that while illegal aliens typically don’t pay federal income taxes, they still contribute through sales taxes, rent-based property taxes, or by using Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITINs). In reality, less than 1% of undocumented immigrants pay payroll or income taxes through the ITIN system. Sales taxes are paid by everyone who buys goods, but in most states sales tax does not fund schools. Public education is primarily supported by local property taxes, and even citizens are required to send their children to schools in the district where they pay those taxes. When undocumented immigrants who do not contribute to local property taxes enroll their children, they are receiving a taxpayer-funded education at the expense of property owners in that district. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stated he was “aware of the troubling incident” and said “the people of Illinois deserve a full, factual accounting of what’s happened today to ensure transparency and accountability.” However, under Illinois law, there is no specific statute granting residents special rights to detailed information about federal immigration enforcement operations beyond standard transparency. Furthermore, this was a federal immigration enforcement action against someone in the country illegally. Illinois residents were not parties to the incident. State Rep. Norma Hernandez declared at a press conference: “Trump and ICE have created this chaos and now deathly consequences to their policies.” In reality, Trump and ICE were enforcing existing federal immigration law under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which gives ICE clear authority to arrest and remove people in the country illegally. Chaos was not created by the president, who was not even present, nor by ICE agents carrying out their duty. It was created by Villegas-Gonzalez, who refused commands, drove his car at officers, and dragged one officer “a significant distance.” The officer, struck and fearing for his life, discharged his weapon. That response fits squarely within standard use-of-force doctrine for situations involving an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm. This is yet another example of a crime, a death, and a severe injury that could have been avoided if people did not enter the country illegally or resist arrest during deportation. Liberals claim to be outraged by the way ICE carries out arrests and removals, but the problem could easily be resolved by encouraging illegal aliens to take vantage of Trump’s self-deportation system . Under that program, they receive $1,000 and a free ticket home, and they remain free to reapply for legal reentry if and when they qualify.
