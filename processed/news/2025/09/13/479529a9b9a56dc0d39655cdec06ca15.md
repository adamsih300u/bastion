The government argues that bringing Diella into cabinet will help institutions opt European practices and improve accountability. President Bajram Begaj has authorized Rama to form the new government, effectively clearing the way for Diella’s inclusion. The opposition Democratic Party, which won 50 seats, has denounced the move as unlawful. Parliamentary leer Gazmend Bardhi denounced the move as “buffoonery,” warning it cannot be treated as legitimate state policy. Lawmakers are expected to vote on Rama’s cabinet soon, but it is not yet clear if Diella’s post will be part of the formal ballot.
