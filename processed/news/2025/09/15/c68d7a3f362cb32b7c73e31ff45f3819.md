Pakistani Men Living in Utah Charged with Lighting Bomb Under FOX Van During Charlie Kirk Assassination Coverage H 'Is He De Yet?' Flag Hanging Outside Their House | The Gateway Pundit | by Cassandra MacDonald Two Arab men were arrested for terrorism and weapons of mass destruction charges after allegedly lighting a bomb under a Fox 13 vehicle in Salt Lake City on Friday as the station was covering the assassination of conservative icon Charlie Kirk. Outside the duo’s home was an upside-down American flag and a flag that re: “Is He De Yet?” eeb Nasir, 58, and il Justice Ahme Nasir, 31, were arrested at their home in Magna, Utah, on Sunday. It is unclear if the men are in a romantic relationship or blood relatives, but they appeared quite cozy together in a photo posted to social media. BREAKING: A Fox News vehicle in Salt Lake City, Utah, was hit with an incendiary device. Two men, eeb Nasir & il Nasir, have been arrested. The Fox crew was covering Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Real device, it just didn’t go off as planned.

It was lit, but malfunctioned, and the flame did not reach the gasoline. FOX 13 reports, “Because of the type of device discovered and where it was located, it was considered a significant threat to public safety, leing the FBI to assume jurisdiction over the case.” A of their home revealed hoax weapons of mass destruction, more explosives, illegal drugs, and two firearms. Neither of the men is allowed to own firearms due to being “restricted persons with known narcotics use.” The men h told law enforcement that the WMD’s found in their home were “real,” prompting an evacuation of nearby homes in the neighborhood. They were later determined to be fake, but other explosives found in the house were not. “Although the warrant was issued for the of evidence related to the incendiary devices found under the FOX 13 News vehicle, law enforcement officials ‘observed ditional contraband and evidence of crimes outside the scope of the original warrant, to include firearms and firearm related items, explosives and explosive-related components, illegal narcotics and associated paraphernalia, as well as electronic devices reasonably believed to contain evidence’ of the original device that was discovered,” Fox 13 reported. There were also anti-Trump flags hanging outside their home, including one that re TACO Trump (a leftist meme meaning Trump Always Chickens Out) and “Is He De Yet?” according to photos posted to social media by Daniel Greenfield of the David Horowitz Freedom Center. This is the Utah house where 2 Muslim men, eeb Nasir and il Justice Ahme Nasir. were arrested after an FBI raid discovered a bomb planted on a car no official motive was released, but they really seemed to hate Tump pic.twitter.com/AGWxdtB031 — Daniel Greenfield – “Hang Together or Separately” (@Sultanknish) September 14, 2025 The men have been charged with manufacturing or possessing a weapon of mass destruction, threat of terrorism, attempted aggravated arson, and possessing incendiary items and their parts. Authorities have requested that they be held without bail due to being a threat to the public. “FOX 13 News is working closely with law-enforcement and our risk management team, with the safety of our employees as our top priority,” FOX 13 Station Manager Leona Wood said in a statement.
