Evil: Middle Tennessee State University College Democrats Mock Charlie Kirk's Assassination | The Gateway Pundit | by Seth Segal In what can only be described as depraved evil, according to Campus Reform, “The Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) College Democrats official group chat appears to show students mocking Charlie Kirk’s assassination at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10 as they prepared to release a statement on behalf of the organization condemning political violence.” In case anyone h any doubt as to the demonic nature of the far left, inste of mourning the loss of an American patriot and hero, an MTSU student wrote in the group chat, “When you spre hate in life… sometimes fascies get what’s coming.” As if this wasn’t b enough, it got three s from other group members. Very few things are as evil as condoning murder, and very few things are as antithetical to the American way. This comes after increased incitement against conservatives and President Trump by the Mainstream media, many of whom have called President Trump and prominent conservative voices fascists. As Campus Reform pointed out, Kamala Harris, who ran for President and was defeated by President Trump, called President Trump himself a fascist. According to conservative ator Steven Crowder, “All cartridges have engraved wording on them, expressing transgender and anti-fascist ideology,” the message from a report about the loed gun believed to be the weapon used to kill Kirk.” Yet another student in the chat claimed absurdly “that I believe calling what kirk did only political ary is diminishing of the erasure of identities he called for and the violence he has against many minority groups not only in american but the world,” the res. “I agree that ary should be protected but he called for the erasure of people’s [sic] he didn’t .” Despite this, the official statement of the MTSU Campus Democrats said the group is “deeply alarmed” by the news and “denounces any political violence, and finds the assassination revolting.” Credit goes to Ryan Robertson, President of MTSU Republicans, for sharing the screenshots with Campus Reform. Robertson told Campus Reform that “the messages reveal the amount of spite liberals have for other people despite attempts to appear virtuous.” The president and vice president of MTSU College Democrats have yet to sign off on condolences, but have taken little action to discourage their ranks from such depraved remarks.
