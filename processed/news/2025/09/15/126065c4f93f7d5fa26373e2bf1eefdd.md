What's Going on in Utah? Another Trans Killer Mia Bailey Slayed Parents Last Year and Was Arrested in St. George - Just Minutes from Charlie Kirk Assassin Tyler Robinson's Home with Trans Boyfriend | The Gateway Pundit | by Cassandra MacDonald In a shocking coincidence, transgender double-murderer Mia Bailey lived in Washington City and was arrested in nearby St. George, just minutes away from the residence d by Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating conservative icon Charlie Kirk, and his transgender partner, Lance Twiggs. Robinson’s parents and Bailey’s parents both lived in Washington, Utah, approximately 5 minutes apart, in a small town of 27,993 people as of 2020. After murdering his parents, Bailey was arrested in St. George, just minutes from the Fossil Hills Townhomes community where Robinson and Twiggs lived together. While no direct connection between the cases has been established, it does raise questions about the ricalization of the transgender community in the area. ‘WE F-CKING DID IT’: X User Connected to Tyler Robinson’s Alleged Boyfriend Celebrated Charlie Kirk’s Death in the Moments After Shooting Mia Bailey, 28, born Collin Troy Bailey, identifies as transgender and has confessed to fatally shooting his parents, Joseph and Gail Bailey, in their Washington City home at 1039 E. Chinook Drive, St. George, on June 18, 2024. According to police reports, Bailey allegedly entered the residence armed with a handgun and fired multiple rounds, killing his parents in what prosecutors describe as a premeditated attack. He also fired shots at his brother and his wife through a locked bedroom door, though they escaped injury. Court documents in the case say Mia told investigators he feels "no remorse for her actions and that she would not change what she h done. Mia stated 'I would do it again. I hate them.'" ing the shootings, Bailey fled the scene, prompting a 12-hour manhunt. He was apprehended the morning, June 19, 2024, near the Mormon temple in St. George after being cornered by law enforcement. Bailey faces charges including two counts of aggravated murder, attempted aggravated murder, aggravated burglary, and multiple counts of discharging a firearm causing serious injury. In a later incident while in custody, Bailey was accused of assaulting two correctional officers in October 2024. As The Gateway Pundit has ly reported , social media posts from at least six social media users appear to foreshow the shooting, suggesting Kirk's death was no lone-wolf act but potentially part of a planned operation within rical transgender circles. Neighbors reported suspicious out-of-state visitors to Robinson's home in the weeks leing up to the shooting, describing them as giving off a "b vibe," further fueling speculation of external coordination. Investigators are now looking into leftist groups both in Utah and online to determine if they aided in the assassination or h knowledge of the plan. In Utah, particularly around the Salt Lake City area, there are several LGBTQ and transgender-focused militant gun groups. One of the groups, Armed Queers of Salt Lake City, which is expressly militant socialist, deleted its Instagram account the day of Kirk's murder.
