Rep. Ilhan Omar Suggests Trump’s America is Worse Than Somalia: ‘I Don’t Remember Ever Witnessing Anything That’ - Omar Fled Somalia in a Plane When Their Compound Was Attacked by 20 Men | The Gateway Pundit | by Ben Kew Far-left Rep. Ilhan Omar has insisted that her home country of Somalia were not as b America is under President Trump. The Minnesota Congresswoman me the s during an appearance this weekend on the YouTube channel Democracy Now! , where she complained about the Trump ministration’s policy of mass deportations and restoring law and order to cities Washington D.C. and Chicago. She explained: Armed men who are in plainclothes that are snatching people off the streets, unwilling to identify themselves. You have the military being deployed in our streets. My God, this is America. You have states’ rights being disregarded. You know, the constitutional crisis that’s being created in front of our eyes. And the same week where we have a president who has deployed the military, who are trained to kill our enemies, not Americans, but our enemies, are in our streets. It’s the same week that we are going to have a military pare. Can you imagine that image that is going to be coming out of our country? I mean, I grew up in a dictatorship. And I don’t even remember ever witnessing anything that. To have a democracy, a beacon of hope for the world, to now be turned into one of the worst countries where the military are in our streets without any regard for people’s constitutional rights. While our president is spending millions of dollars prompting himself up a failed dictator with a military pare. It is really shocking and it should be a wake-up call for all Americans to say this is not the country we were born in, this is not the country we believe in, this is not the country our founding fathers imagined, and this is not the country that is supported by our constitution, our ideals, our values. We should all collectively be out in the streets rejecting what is taking place this week. Watch the clip below: Ilhan Omar says that Somalia is a better country than the United States pic.twitter.com/xmp6WUhtxW — aka (@akafaceUS) September 14, 2025 When Omar and her family arrived in the U.S. in 1995, Somalia was alrey a failed state. The central government h been overthrown years earlier, leaving the country carved up by rival warlords and militias who terrorized civilians with violence, extortion, and checkpoints. Law and order h completely disintegrated, and famine and disease h alrey killed hundreds of thousands. That same year, the United Nations abandoned its failed peacekeeping mission, pulling out after years of bloodshed and humiliation. Somalia was left a stateless wasteland where survival depended on clan loyalties and the barrel of a gun. Rical Democrat Ilhan Omar and her privileged family fled Somalia in a plane after a gang of 20 armed men attacked their private compound. Flashback: Ilhan Omar’s Father was Top Propaganda Official in Genocidal Somalian Barre Regime – Then He Changed His and Her Name and Entered US Illegally The country’s situation has not improved much since. It is widely considered the most dangerous country on earth, with the U.S. State Department urging Americans not to travel there under any circumstances.
