The radical Left’s poison has seeped so deep into American institutions that even the people entrusted with our lives at 30,000 feet are openly glorifying political assassinations.

The Gateway Pundit | by Jim Hᴏft The rical Left’s poison has seeped so deep into American institutions that even the people entrusted with our lives at 30,000 feet are openly glorifying political assassinations. According to Milo Yiannopoulos, Andrew Schweizer, a pilot affiliated with United and SkyWest Airlines, was exposed for celebrating the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, calling him a “f***ing Nazi” and sneering that the “only good kind of Nazi is a de Nazi.” In now-viral posts, Schweizer left no doubt about where he stood: “This is all going to be over one way or another soon and so I don’t want there ever to be a question of what I thought or where I stood. Charlie Kirk was a f***ing Nazi and the only good kind of Nazi is a de Nazi. There is no reality in which anyone is better off with him being alive. I won’t pretend to be even slightly conflicted or upset someone put him down. And yes I chose those words deliberately.” Schweizer didn’t stop there. He went on to mock the seriousness of his remarks with divisive racial and political rhetoric: “So I would, with all respect, appreciate you not minimizing this as something that is in any way normal or precedented. At least here. I mean… unless you’re Black I guess.” And in another shocking , Schweizer ded: “At least when I’m waiting for my execution I’ll never know if it was because I’m a unionist, Jewish, or an ally. And maybe they’ll re out all three. I’d be okay with that.” Andrew Schweizer, a pilot for @united and @SkyWestAirlines , says he is gl Charlie Kirk is de, because he was a “fucking Nazi,” stressing that he “chose those words deliberately.” Would you put your life in Andrew’s hands? pic.twitter.com/ucQmdlfnOK — MILO (@Nero) September 12, 2025 ing Milo’s revelations and mounting public outrage, United Airlines confirmed that Schweizer has been “removed from service.” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy praised the decision, but demanded more: “Thank you United for doing what’s right by placing pilots celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk out of service. They must be fired. There’s no room for political violence in America and anyone applauding it will face the consequences. ESPECIALLY those we count on to ensure the safety of the flying public.” Charlie Kirk’s assassination was a national tragedy. But the celebration of his murder by people in positions of power, whether professors, celebrities, or pilots, shows that the cancer of political violence has metastasized. Inste of mourning, these extremists cheer. Inste of condemning, they justify.
