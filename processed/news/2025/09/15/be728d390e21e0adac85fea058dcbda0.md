New York Governor Kathy Hochul has announced her endorsement of the communist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul Endorses Communist Zohran Mamdani in NYC Mayoral Race - Says He Will Not Surrender ‘One Inch’ to President Trump | The Gateway Pundit | by Ben Kew New York Governor Kathy Hochul has announced her endorsement of the communist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. In an opinion piece for The New York Times, Hochul said that she trusted Mamdani would not surrender “one inch” to President Trump. She wrote: In the past few months, I’ve h frank conversations with him. We’ve h our disagreements. But in our conversations, I heard a leer who s my commitment to a New York where children can grow up safe in their neighborhoods and where opportunity is within reach for every family. I heard a leer who is focused on making New York City affordable — a goal I enthusiastically support. … And in light of the abhorrent and destructive policies coming out of Washington every day, I needed to know the mayor would not be someone who would surrender one inch to Donald Trump. I didn’t leave my conversations with him aligned on every issue. But I am confident that he has the courage, urgency and optimism New York City needs to le it through the challenges of this moment. New York City deserves a mayor who will stand up to Donald Trump and make life more affordable for New Yorkers. That’s @ZohranKMamdani . https://t.co/i9I0OzDdXJ — Kathy Hochul (@KathyHochul) September 14, 2025 Hochul’s endorsement comes amid growing divisions among the Democratic establishment about whether to endorse Mamdani, given that he is a self-confessed communist and a strong sympathizer of Islamism. Just this weekend, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen threw his support behind Mamdani, arguing that he would help ensure “people can afford to live in the place where they work. Van Hollen also chastised Democratic leers who have so far refused to endorse his campaign. “Yet, many Democratic members of the Senate and the House representing New York have stayed on the sidelines,” Van Hollen said. “That kind of spineless politics is what people are sick of. They need to get behind him and get behind him now.” Sen. Chris Van Hollen Says ‘Spineless’ Democrats Must Endorse Communist Zohran Mamdani For NYC Mayor: ‘Get Behind Him Now’ (VIDEO) Such endorsements may not even be necessary given the findings of recent polls. Last week, a poll by Siena and The New York Times found that Mamdani holds a commanding 22 percent le over Hochul’s “moderate” predecessor, Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent. Mamdani is currently projected to win 46 percent of the vote, with Cuomo trailing behind at 24 percent. Republican Curtis Silwa is polling at 15 percent, while incumbent Mayor Eric ams is on just nine percent. However, there is speculation that Silwa and ams may drop out of the race to give Cuomo the greatest chance of victory.
