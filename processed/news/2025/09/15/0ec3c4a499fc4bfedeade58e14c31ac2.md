Governor Kathy Hochul has officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani, the most openly radical socialist in New York politics and a candidate who has repeatedly targeted Jewish New Yorkers and mainstream Americans alike.

The Gateway Pundit | by Gregory Lyakhov Governor Kathy Hochul has officially endorsed Zohran Mamdani , the most openly rical socialist in New York politics and a candidate who has repeatedly targeted Jewish New Yorkers and mainstream Americans a. That endorsement should raise eyebrows on its own. But it becomes even more disturbing when paired with her track record of reckless, ideologically driven governance. For years, Hochul has diverted public resources away from acemics, safety, and infrastructure to fund inste an unaccountable network of DEI programs—programs that have failed to improve education, wasted taxpayer dollars, and divided communities across the state. WATCH: Zohran Mamdani’s DISASTROUS Education Policies Debunked | Patriot Perspective While Mamdani vocates slogans about “decolonizing” New York City, Governor Hochul has quietly invested billions in policies that achieve precisely that goal. Under her leership, DEI has gone from an abstract concept to the central framework of state education policy. Race, gender, and identity are now the primary factors in determining how students are treated, how teachers are hired, and how curricula are developed. In the 2025 “People’s Budget,” Hochul green lit millions of dollars for race-conscious initiatives with no acemic benefit: $8 million for race-based teacher recruitment, $250,000 for ideological classroom programming, and $3 million for a regional DEI museum exhibit in the irondacks. These are not isolated line items. They’re part of a broer shift—one that replaces merit with identity politics. In many schools, opportunities for scholarships, summer programs, and college prep are now limited to students deemed “underrepresented,” regardless of individual need or achievement. Teachers are chosen not for their experience or ability to improve student outcomes, but based on demographic quotas. Lesson plans increasingly prioritize grievance-based frameworks over foundational civic knowledge or critical thinking. And the results speak for themselves. Less than half of New York State’s students are proficient in reing and math. In New York City, which spends over $40,000 per student—more than any other major city in America—acemic performance continues to decline. Meanwhile, absenteeism is rising, buildings are falling apart, and many classrooms are still using outdated textbooks. While families across the state ask for safer schools, better facilities, and more acemic support, Hochul has me it clear that symbolic politics come first. Even federal pressure hasn’t been enough to change course. The Trump ministration has warned states that race-based DEI initiatives may put federal education funding at risk—up to $2 billion in New York’s case. But Hochul refuses to scale back, even if it means putting classrooms, teachers, and struggling students on the chopping block. Her choice to preserve DEI ideology over basic acemic recovery is sabotage. By endorsing Mamdani, Hochul is doubling down on a governing vision that treats identity as more important than outcomes, slogans as more important than standards, and politics as more important than students. If that’s the future of New York, then parents, students, and taxpayers a should be deeply concerned. Hochul didn’t just endorse Mamdani—she paved the way for him.
