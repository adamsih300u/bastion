Shortly after the assassination of Charlie Kirk, the media attacked President Trump for blaming the radical left.

The Gateway Pundit | by Antonio Graceffo Shortly after the assassination of Charlie Kirk , the media attacked President Trump for blaming the rical left. Outlets suggested the shooter might have been a disgruntled right-winger who thought Kirk wasn’t conservative enough, or even floated the absurd idea that it was an accident, a supporter firing a gun in celebration. One prominent mainstream media article claimed, “Some have attempted to draw a link between Robinson and the far-right Groyper movement,” but provided no actual evidence for this connection. The claim that “Tyler apparently told police that he mired Nick Fuentes” appears in one source but remains disputed and unverified. The dishonesty was staggering , echoing how the press h tried to portray the Trump shooter as a Trump supporter. Occam’s razor points to the simplest and most obvious explanation: the shooter hated conservatives, and in Kirk’s case, was a left-wing extremist with ties to trans ideology. Unsurprisingly, that turned out to be correct. So far, the media has not apologized to Trump or to conservatives who correctly identified the shooter’s motives from the beginning. Based on available evidence, Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, appears to have been motivated by left-wing, antifascist ideology. FBI sources confirmed that bullet casings were engraved with slogans tied to transgender and antifascist themes, including “Hey fascist! Catch!” a phrase echoing Antifa rhetoric and lyrics from Bella Ciao , the Italian antifascist anthem now co-opted by Antifa. Robinson was living in a romantic relationship with a transgender boyfriend (male transitioning to female), and investigators believe his anger at Kirk stemmed in part from viewing Kirk’s positions on gender identity as “hateful” toward people his partner. This relationship is seen as a key element in establishing motive. Friends and family stated that although Robinson’s family was conservative, he h become increasingly political in recent years and expressed hatred for both Trump and Charlie Kirk. At a recent dinner, he even mentioned Kirk’s upcoming campus event. Taken together, the physical evidence on the ammunition, his personal relationships, and his stated opposition to Kirk’s conservative views, especially on transgender issue, point to a left-wing political assassination driven by antifascist and LGBTQ-related grievances. The timing of the shooting was also strangely coincidental. Just moments before the attack, an audience member asked Kirk about transgender mass shooters: “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” They ed up with, “Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America over the last 10 years?” Kirk replied, “Counting or not counting gang violence?” Moments later, he was assassinated. Another odd detail centers on Robinson’s transgender roommate and partner. After the shooting, Robinson reportedly sent messages about hiding the weapon or retrieving it from a drop point. Investigators say the partner has been “extremely cooperative,” turning over messages that described leaving a rifle in a bush wrapped in a towel and watching the area where it was left. FBI officials confirmed that “text messages and other communications between Robinson and his partner helped agents zero in on Robinson.” The partner has insisted they h “no idea” about the assassination plot and was “aghast” at the killing. The FBI seized evidence from their d apartment, including computers now being analyzed at Quantico. While sources told Axios that “it’s pretty clear that Robinson’s roommate knew a lot and didn’t say anything after the killing,” authorities have not named the partner as a suspect and continue to describe them as cooperative. Separately, The Sun reported that agents are reviewing doorbell footage allegedly showing Robinson on the phone “moments after it went down,” discussing explicit details of the shooting with an unidentified person. This has raised questions about whether Robinson h an accomplice or someone who knew of the crime but stayed silent. Officials initially said they believed he acted alone but emphasized they are “not leaving out any avenues.” Robinson h become more political in recent years, openly criticizing Kirk, and authorities recovered bullet shells engraved with antifascist slogans. His grandmother told the Daily Mail that the family is Republican. At the press conference announcing his arrest, the FBI declared, “We got him.” Director Kash Patel ded, “To my friend Charlie Kirk. Rest now brother. We have the watch and I’ll see you in Valhalla.” Although the evidence suggests the roommate may have known about Robinson’s efforts to conceal the gun after the crime, investigators have so far maintained that Robinson “acted alone” in carrying out the assassination.
