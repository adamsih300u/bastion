American Airlines has removed from service one of its own pilots who openly CELEBRATED the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk.

American Airlines Pilot Who Celebrated Charlie Kirk’s Assassination in His “Fat F**king Forehe” Immediately Removed from Service | The Gateway Pundit | by Jim Hᴏft American Airlines has removed from service one of its own pilots who openly CELEBRATED the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. On Friday, Milo Yiannopoulos posted on X that Steve Holmes, a pilot for American Air, mocked Charlie Kirk’s killing with a vile rant: “Well hey Charlie. Sorry you got shot in your fat f**king forehe. It was just the cost of our liberty. Thoughts and prayers.” The grotesque post, which me light of the killing of one of America’s most prominent conservative figures, quickly went viral. Actor James Woods retweeted Milo’s screenshot with the chilling : “Enjoy your flight!” Enjoy your flight! https://t.co/lLeg9Lf24B — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) September 13, 2025 The airline moved quickly to save face, releasing a corporate statement: “American Airlines condemns violence of any kind. Furthermore, hate-related or hostile behavior runs contrary to our purpose, which is to care for people on life’s journey. Any such behavior is unacceptable, and we have alrey initiated action to dress this with our team.” American Airlines condemns violence of any kind. Furthermore, hate-related or hostile behavior runs contrary to our purpose, which is to care for people on life’s journey. Any such behavior is unacceptable, and we have alrey initiated action to dress this with our team. — americanair (@AmericanAir) September 13, 2025 But the real hammer dropped when Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy weighed in on X, delivering a no-holds-barred takedown of the pilot’s depravity. Sec. Duffy announced that Holmes and other pilots who celebrated Kirk’s assassination have been removed from service. “American Airlines pilots who were caught celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk have been immediately grounded and removed from service by American Air. This behavior is disgusting and they should be fired. Any company responsible for the safety of the traveling public cannot tolerate that behavior. We heal as a country when we send the message that glorifying political violence is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE!” American Airlines pilots who were caught celebrating the assassination of Charlie Kirk have been immediately grounded and removed from service by @AmericanAir . This behavior is disgusting and they should be fired. Any company responsible for the safety of the traveling public… https://t.co/nq2B3G84hu — Secretary Sean Duffy (@SecDuffy) September 13, 2025 This grotesque episode underscores a growing reality that political violence against conservatives is not only tolerated but openly celebrated. Imagine if the roles were reversed—if a conservative airline pilot mocked the death of a left-wing figure. The media would alrey be in a 24/7 meltdown, demanding permanent bans, lawsuits, and retribution.
