The Gateway Pundit | by Gregory Lyakhov The assassination of Charlie Kirk has not silenced his movement—it has ignited it. Within just two days of his killing at Utah Valley University, Turning Point USA received more than 32,000 requests to establish new chapters across the country. For perspective, TPUSA h alrey built a presence on more than 3,500 campuses nationwide. But Kirk’s death has turned his vision into an unstoppable reality. Andrew Kolvet, producer of The Charlie Kirk Show , revealed the explosive growth in a post on X. He noted that Kirk h long dreamed of seeing a TPUSA-affiliated “Club America” in every high school—about 23,000 schools across the United States. “The organization has received over 32,000 inquiries in the last 48 hours to start new campus chapters,” Kolvet wrote. “Charlie’s vision…will come true much faster than he could have ever possibly imagined. Truly incredible.” The reaction is a testament not only to Kirk’s influence but also to the vacuum left by his absence. For years, Charlie provided young conservatives with a platform to challenge the norms on their campuses. He gave students a reason to believe that conservatism was not only alive but growing stronger. Now, in his death, Kirk’s legacy is multiplying. Charlie Kirk’s methods were often controversial, his style unapologetically direct, but the results spoke for themselves. He energized a generation that felt alienated by progressive dominance on campuses. Now, even in death, he is recruiting thousands more. The assassination that was meant to silence him has produced the opposite effect. Students are not retreating from the cause— they are stepping forward. Requests for chapters represent individual young Americans rey to carry the conservative message into hostile environments where it is most needed. Charlie Kirk’s death was a tragedy, but his movement shows no signs of collapsing. Inste, it is accelerating. The sudden surge in Turning Point USA chapter requests underscores that his vision has outgrown even the founder himself. His murder has ensured that his legacy will live on—not in words, but in action, through the young leers who will take up his banner. At its core, this is the turning point. And it proves that even when a man is silenced, his ideas cannot be.
