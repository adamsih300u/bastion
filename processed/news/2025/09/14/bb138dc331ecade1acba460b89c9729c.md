Her list of professional awards includes the Gracie Award, the David Kaplan Award, the Daniel Pearl Award and the John Aubuchon Press Freedom Award among others. Lara posted her tribute video to Charlie in lew of her regular “Lara Logan Going Rogue” weekly investigative report. Lara tears up as she describes her friend in a personal letter and the time they d together. Lara Logan: It is hard to believe, still. The shock comes and goes, and so does the grief, but here we are. I see you smiling, tossing hats into the crowd, alive with fire and joy. That is the image of you that endures, one of power and love, with light in your eyes, the light of God that once set fire to the stars. The moment I heard you were gone, the moment I heard I knew you were gone, but I prayed anyway because I wasn’t just praying for you. I prayed for your beautiful Erica and your children and all who love you. But I prayed also for all of us. I prayed for us because in that moment, God showed me how much we h been leaning on you. I saw the weight of all you h done and how much ground h shifted because you were willing to walk on it with courage. People who maybe didn’t know your name, counting on you without knowing. Why? Because you were the only one brave enough to walk a forbidden path onto college campuses, marching with purpose into the hallowed halls of indoctrination with a disarming smile, the armor of God and the sword of the spirit, which we know is the truth… …You showed how America’s noble places of learning h become centers of anti-American hatred, where rical anarchist and Marxist indoctrination h turned critical thinking and freedom of thought into a war crime. You revealed how their children h been taken hostage by a system that forced them to become someone else just to survive. a cult, they h to turn their backs on who they were and sacrifice their families, parents, and their faith on the altar of unforgiveness, where anyone who did not agree h no right to live. Charlie, you saw all of this and rejected it. You would not bear a false witness, and you would not bow… … Yet somehow, you were bigger than all of us, and yet one of us still at the same time. One reason was That much the man you ored Jesus Christ, you love to people. It is a love you cannot fake or manufacture, and it’s permanently revealed in word and deed with consistency over time. People know in their hearts and their souls if it’s real or not. It’s a certainty that no one can take away. Millions of people loved you back, none more so than the college kids who found their courage because you never lost yours. They loved you for the way you stood your ground, fought for them with grace. You brought them out of hiding and into the light. The chapters you created gave them protection and a home. Some people may have forgotten how you were protested and blocked and attacked. I I have not, and I am not alone… …Charlie, your words traveled far and wide in your lifetime, but in death, they will reach beyond lifetimes and echo for generations. Your message will not be lost because you are the message. And you lived the word, and God spoke through you to rest in the hearts of all. My prayer for you is that Erika and your children find comfort and peace in their faith and the power of your love and the love of God, which conquers all and surpasses all of our understanding. In Jesus’ name we pray. Amen. Here is the full video. It is very powerful.
