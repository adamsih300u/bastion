BREAKING: Investigation into Charlie Kirk Assassination Attempt Widens to Probe Rical Pro-Trans Online Groups, Including on Steam | The Gateway Pundit | by Cassandra MacDonald The investigation into the attempted assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has expanded to scrutinize pro-trans online communities, including the Steam group that The Gateway Pundit reported on early Sunday morning, to determine if others were aware of or involved with the plan to kill the conservative icon. As TGP reported, Robinson appears to have been a member of a bizarre Steam group named “Re This If Your Gay,” a title that eerily mirrors the mocking inscription “If you re this, you are gay LMAO,” which was etched on a bullet casing at the crime scene. The New York Post reports : Law enforcement sources said that investigators are examining leftist groups both in Utah and online to figure out if they helped him with the shooting — or at least heard it was going to happen. The probe includes groups in online gaming community Steam, as well as a pro-trans organization called Armed Queers SLC, which took down their Instagram after Kirk was killed, the source confirmed. Steam is a video game platform that lets you play, discuss, and create games on your computer. Incredibly, members of the group were issued a frantic warning to switch to encrypted chats just hours after the fatal shooting but before Robinson’s arrest, indicating that they may have h information about the shooter. A cryptic announcement was posted in the group on September 10 at 11:24 PM, mere hours after Kirk’s shooting, but crucially before Robinson’s arrest. Penned by a user named “CHERRY SYLVEON,” the message warned: “be careful over sh-t you say online end to end encryption messaging platforms signal exists for a reason or just use PGP and yes, this is directly referencing a very specific thing that happened.” Kirk was fatally shot on Wednesday, September 10, during an event at Utah Valley University. Robinson was captured after a tense 33-hour manhunt, thanks in part to tips from his own family. But as details emerge, a web of disturbing connections points to a possible broer conspiracy involving online ricalism, transgender networks, and even hints of foreknowledge among left-wing activists. ding to the chilling narrative are Robinson’s own flippant jokes me in Discord chats with 20 other users while he was on the run. He reportedly quipped to friends that a “doppelganger” was responsible for the shooting after the FBI released images of the suspect. ‘WE F-CKING DID IT’: X User Connected to Tyler Robinson’s Alleged Boyfriend Celebrated Charlie Kirk’s Death in the Moments After Shooting The plot thickens with social media posts from other users that appear to foreshow the shooting, suggesting Kirk's death was no lone-wolf act but potentially part of a planned operation within rical left-wing circles. On September 9, an account under the handle "NajraGalvz" posted, "Charlie Kirk is coming to my college tomorrow I rlly hope someone evaporates him literally," ed several hours later by, "Lets just say something big will happen tomorrow," accompanied by a grinning dog image. Earlier, on September 5, a social media user named "Fujoshincel" teased "something BIG coming soon" and urged ers to watch the news; after the shooting on September 10, the same account gloated, "Well that’s that" and "Another Chud Bites the Dust." A transgender user ed by Robinsom's boyfriend Lance Twiggs on X, and who ed them back, celebrated with "WE F-CKING DID IT" as reports emerged, ed by "LET IT DIE. LET IT DIE" when Kirk was reported to be in critical condition. Same transgender that was friends with Tyler’s gay transgender boyfriend posted “WE FUCKING DID IT” moments after Charlie’s death. @FBI https://t.co/AlX6Mx4pPY pic.twitter.com/Zk7KiRiMjz — Aesthetica (@Anc_Aesthetics) September 13, 2025 A transgender that Tyler Robinson’s boyfriend s on tik tok celebrating Charlie’s murder.

Westgate (@a_westgate) September 11, 2025 These posts, many from transgender-linked accounts, scream of premeditation and involvement of coconspirators. A post on TikTok from the day before the shooting said, "Charles James Kirk. Mr. College Drop out does not know whats coming tomorrow. Be rey. This isn’t a threat. It’s a promise…" WOW. “Charles James Kirk. Mr. College Drop out does not know whats coming tomorrow. Be rey. This isn’t a threat.

"Their username is 'tallyhallalbum.' Tyler Robinson h a Tally Hall Spotify Playlist, and his boyfriend was active in the /r/tallyhall subreddit. This is significant not because of the band (which broke up in 2011) but because close-knit friend groups tend to the same interests and fandoms." It wouldn't be the first Trantifa terror cell to be uncovered in recent times. A violent transgender cult, known as the "Zizians" or "Ziz Cult," has been linked to multiple murders across states, including the fatal shooting of Border Patrol Agent David Maland in early 2025. The cult, described as a "trans vegan terror cult," is accused of orchestrating violent acts against law enforcement and perceived enemies, with members tied to killings in Vermont, North Carolina, and beyond. The group's leer, Jack LaSota, was arrested in Maryland , and appeared to have me preparations for widespre violence. Robinson's own connections, living with his transitioning boyfriend and embedded in online communities rife with anti-fascist rhetoric, mirror the Zizians' profile. Neighbors reported suspicious out-of-state visitors to Robinson's home in the weeks leing up to the shooting, describing them as giving off a "b vibe," further fueling speculation of external coordination. ‘WE F-CKING DID IT’: X User Connected to Tyler Robinson’s Alleged Boyfriend Celebrated Charlie Kirk’s Death in the Moments After Shooting As the FBI delves into Robinson's Discord history, anti-fascist ties, and these foreshowing posts, one thing is clear: this wasn't just a random act of hatred. It smells a coordinated effort from the rical left, amplified by transgender extremism and online echo chambers. Robinson faces charges including aggravated murder, discharge of a firearm causing serious injury, and obstruction of justice, and could face Utah's death penalty by firing squ if convicted. The Gateway Pundit will continue to monitor this developing story and provide updates as they become available.
