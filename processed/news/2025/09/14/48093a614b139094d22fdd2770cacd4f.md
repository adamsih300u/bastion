We are truly up against evil.

PURE EVIL: Leftists on Roblox Are Uploing Sick Games for Children to Relive Charlie Kirk Shooting | The Gateway Pundit | by Jim Hoft We are truly up against evil. Roblox announced on Thursday that the company h taken down more than 100 experiences referencing Charlie Kirk and his assassination on their platform. According to its app , Roblox is the ultimate virtual universe that lets you create, experiences with friends, and be anything you can imagine. The game is very with children. Over half of the users on Roblox are under the age of 16. Rep. Paulina Luna was first to expose that Roblox h a game on their platform referencing Charlie Kirk’s assassination. The rical left is desperate to promote their evil to the hearts and minds of innocent children. These are also the same people who laughed at Charlie’s death. They really don’t care about life and they must be defeated. Steve Bannon and Rasmussen Reports’ COO Mark Mitchell discussed this on the War Room on Saturday morning. Via Karli Bonne .
