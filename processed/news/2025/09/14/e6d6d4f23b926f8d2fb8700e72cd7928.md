A neighbor’s eyewitness account of suspicious activity at accused Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson’s Utah residence, which he shared with a transgender boyfriend, has raised suspicions about possible involvement from out-of-state radicals.

Transgender Social Media Users Posting Hints of Foreknowledge and Suspicious Out-of-State Visitors at Alleged Kirk Assassin's Home Raise Serious Terror Network Concerns | The Gateway Pundit | by Cassandra MacDonald A neighbor’s eyewitness account of suspicious activity at accused Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson’s Utah residence, which he d with a transgender boyfriend, has raised suspicions about possible involvement from out-of-state ricals. Robinson is accused of shooting Kirk, 31, moments after the Turning Point USA founder dressed a question on transgender mass shooters. “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?” leftist attendee Hunter Kozak asked Kirk before the single gunshot that would take his life rang out. Investigators are now reportedly digging into Robinson’s connections, including his relationship with 22-year-old Lance Twiggs, who is transitioning from male to female and has been cooperating with the FBI. The pair d a modest $1,800-a-month townhouse in St. George, Utah, which was raided by law enforcement on Friday. A neighbor, speaking on condition of anonymity to The New York Post, reported seeing several people driving vehicles with out-of-state license plates entering and exiting the home approximately two weeks before the shooting. “They did not give off a good vibe,” the neighbor said. According to a report from Axios late Saturday evening, citing six sources familiar with the case, “Federal and state law enforcement officials also are examining leftist groups in Utah to see whether they h knowledge of the alleged shooter’s plans beforehand, or if they lent material support to him afterward.” The report states that one of the groups deleted their social media account after the shooting took place. “It’s pretty clear that Robinson’s roommate knew a lot and didn’t say anything after the killing, so they’re a person of interest officially and are cooperating,” an official told the outlet. “We want to keep it that way.” “What we want to know is if anyone else h knowledge [of the shooting], before or after,” that source ded. This witness’s and Axios report have fueled speculation about whether Robinson was part of a larger network, possibly ricalized by left-wing ideologies, particularly because multiple posts on social media from at least six people involved with the transgender community appeared to boast of vance knowledge of the crime. 3) Tyler’s transgender boyfriend is friends with a transgender account on tik tok and X that goes by the name “churbum75m (saw Tyler June 30th)” Minutes after Charlie was confirmed de this transgender posted “WE FUCKING DID IT” pic.twitter.com/CwdLuRXeWt — Aesthetica (@Anc_Aesthetics) September 13, 2025 An account with the handle “NajraGalvz” posted on September 9, “Charlie Kirk is coming to my college tomorrow I rlly hope someone evaporates him literally.” A few hours later, they ded the update, “Lets just say something big will happen tomorrow,” with an image of a dog that appears to be grinning. 4) But this wasn’t the only transgender account that h prior knowledge of the assassination. At least two other transgender people h posted in vance that something would happen to Charlie during his speaking event at UVU. pic.twitter.com/HIwsh6c3AR — Aesthetica (@Anc_Aesthetics) September 13, 2025 He posted his face last year pic.twitter.com/grN9RaElMK — McCarthy was right about everything ☭⃠ (@Rape_Communists) September 13, 2025 Another X account, with the handle “Fujoshincel,” posted on September 5 about “something BIG coming soon,” urging ers to check the news. Five days later, shortly after Kirk’s death was confirmed, they quoted the post and wrote, “Well that’s that,” and ed up by saying, “Another Chud Bites the Dust.” Another transgender account has been found to have h prior knowledge of the assassination. That’s now 6 far left trans terrorists who h vanced knowledge. pic.twitter.com/X9c3ylGkvK — Aesthetica (@Anc_Aesthetics) September 13, 2025 Another account that appears to be in a related subculture posted on August 6, “september 10th will be a very interesting day.” On September 10, after Kirk’s murder, they quoted their own post from the month before and wrote, “I ple the fifth.” Go after this guy too. In his own words, he “predicted” it. There appears to have been a large cell of people who knew this was gonna happen. @zuki_2024 @Anc_Aesthetics pic.twitter.com/408bRzXwfB — Noah Jones (@noahjones4321) September 13, 2025 Also, as the Gateway Pundit ly reported , a transgender biological male from Utah posted a song to SoundCloud titled “Charlie Kirk De at 31” a month before his assassination. The person behind the SoundCloud project appears to use the name Skye Valez and identifies as “she/her” on social media. Valez also posted a song titled “Charlie Kirk’s Death Isn’t Enough for Me.” 4chan intel identified suspect Skye Valez >h a soundcloud with a track that was uploed with a track a month ago titled “Charlie Kirk De at 31” >deleted the track and changed his location to “leave me alone” >lives in Utah >troon pic.twitter.com/JTye3IsHgF — A. Westgate (@a_westgate) September 11, 2025 Transgender Biological Utah Man H a Song Called ‘Charlie Kirk De at 31’ on SoundCloud Prior to Assassination (UPDATED) The revelation also drew eerie parallels to a recent foiled assassination plot against an ICE agent in Texas involving a group of transgender activists. In August, seven transgender individuals sharing a house were implicated, leing to an FBI raid on their property. A neighbor there echoed similar suspicions, noting, "It was weird enough that six or seven White, trans people moved into the neighborhood... And now the FBI is raiding their house." As the FBI probes the evidence, including Robinson's Discord messages and possible ties to anti-fascist networks, conservatives demand answers. Is this actually the work of a lone wolf, or part of a broer transgender terror network? The out-of-state visitors and Texas parallels suggest the latter. Robinson is scheduled to make his first court appearance, virtually, on Tuesday. He is charged with murder, aggravated murder, felony discharge of a weapon causing serious bodily injury, and obstruction of justice. The accused assassin is currently being held without bail. Utah is a death penalty state. Robinson will be eligible to face a firing squ if convicted.
