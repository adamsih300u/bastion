President Trump has announced that he is prepared to sanction Russia, but only if every NATO ally stops importing Russian oil and introduces matching penalties of their own.

Trump ‘Rey’ to Impose ditional Sanctions on Russia - But Only on Certain Conditions | The Gateway Pundit | by Ben Kew President Trump has announced that he is prepared to sanction Russia, but only if every NATO ally stops importing Russian oil and introduces matching penalties of their own. He wrote on Truth Social: A LETTER SENT BY PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP TO ALL NATO NATIONS AND, THE WORLD: “I am rey to do major Sanctions on Russia when all NATO Nations have agreed, and started, to do the same thing, and when all NATO Nations STOP BUYING OIL FROM RUSSIA. As you know, NATO’S commitment to WIN has been far less than 100%, and the purchase of Russian Oil, by some, has been shocking! It greatly weakens your negotiating position, and bargaining power, over Russia. Anyway, I am rey to “go” when you are. Just say when? I believe that this, plus NATO, as a group, placing 50% to 100% TARIFFS ON CHINA, to be fully withdrawn after the WAR with Russia and Ukraine is ended, will also be of great help in ENDING this dely, but RIDICULOUS, WAR. China has a strong control, and even grip, over Russia, and these powerful Tariffs will break that grip. This is not TRUMP’S WAR (it would never have started if I was President!), it is Biden’s and Zelenskyy’s WAR. I am only here to help stop it, and save thousands of Russian and Ukrainian lives (7,118 lives lost last week, alone. CRAZY!). If NATO does as I say, the WAR will end quickly, and all of those lives will be saved! If not, you are just wasting my time, and the time, energy, and money of the United States. Thank you for your attention to this matter! DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.” Turkey, a NATO member, currently ranks as the third-largest importer of Russian petroleum, behind China and India, according to the Centre for Re on Energy and Clean Air. Other members still purchasing from Moscow include Hungary and Slovakia. Trump has alrey introduced a 25 percent tariff on Indian goods due to its energy tre with Moscow. BREAKING: President Trump is putting his foot down on Putin — revealing he’s rey for “MAJOR SANCTIONS” on Russia, and running a full NATO BOYCOTT on Russian oil. Maximum pressure time. PLUS, up to 100% CHINA tariffs. Wow. Trump tells NATO: If you don’t do this, you’re… pic.twitter.com/Anuc7mko4N — Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) September 13, 2025 However, he has not extended that policy to China, despite Beijing strengthening its partnership with Vlimir Putin ing their recent summit in the Chinese capital. Trump’s remarks came as tensions escalated in Europe after Russian drones entered Polish airspace on Wednesday, leing NATO to announce a new mission designed to reinforce its eastern defenses.
