In Germany, free speech is under siege, and the latest victim is Björn Höcke, the chair of the Alternative for Germany (AfD)’s Thuringian state branch.

Germany's Free Speech Crackdown: AfD Thuringia State Chairman Björn Höcke Fined $35,000 for Saying "Everything for Germany" | The Gateway Pundit | by Robert Semonsen In Germany, free speech is under siege, and the victim is Björn Höcke, the chair of the Alternative for Germany (AfD)’s Thuringian state branch. Höcke, a true patriot fighting for his nation’s self-determination, achieved AfD’s inaugural first-place finish in a state election. Höcke was slapped with fines totaling around $35,000 for simply uttering the phrase “Alles für Deutschland” – “Everything for Germany” – in public speeches. The ruling parties in Germany have been weaponizing the judicial system against the AfD, and this outrageous ruling from the Federal Judicial Court seeks to silence patriots who dare to put their country first. Björn Höcke ( AfD), the German superstar for the patriotic AfD, speaks on the ruling of the Federal Judicial Court against him, an ditional massive attack on free speech in Germany. For only stating in a public speech 2021 the wording „Alles für Deutschland“ [ Everything for… pic.twitter.com/dT4kAYJsmF — Wolfgang Schütt (@WolfgangSchuett) September 13, 2025 Höcke’s troubles began in 2021 when he ended a rally speech in Merseburg with the words, inspiring crowds with a call to national pride. Prosecutors claimed the slogan echoes Nazi-era, leing to his first conviction and a €13,000 fine in May 2024. He faced a second trial for a 2023 event in Gera, where he prompted the audience to complete the phrase, resulting in another €16,900 penalty. The slogan “Alles für Deutschland,” however, has deep roots in German history. Originating in the 16th century, it became a rallying cry in the 19th century for national unity during the Unification Movement. King Ludwig I of Bavaria famously used it in an 1848 proclamation, declaring “Everything for my people! Everything for Germany!” to inspire his people during revolutionary times. The Nazis later co-opted the phrase as the paramilitary SA Storm Division’s motto, engraving it on daggers and belts, which is the basis for the judicial ruling against Höcke, despite the fact that Social Democrat and Christian freedom fighters were using the slogan in opposition to the Nazi Party. Post-World War II, during the Marshall Plan era, the slogan returned to symbolize dedication to national recovery amid economic revival. Yet, the slogan grually became restricted under laws against unconstitutional symbols. These laws have been slowly weaponized to wage lawfare against opposition figures Höcke. Germany’s anti-free speech laws stifle debate in ways unimaginable under our First Amendment. While U.S. populists can proudly say “Make America Great Again” without fear, Germans Höcke are fined for expressing their love for their nation. Höcke is not backing down and has offered a powerful message to the people of Germany: “We want a free world, and we want to move into the future as free people. And arguing for it, fighting for it, and sometimes even suffering for it, is worth it, despite everything.” Höcke vows to fight on for a sovereign and free Germany. His supporters now chant “Alles für Höcke!” in defiance of the globalist regime that wants to stomp out the free expression of the German people.
