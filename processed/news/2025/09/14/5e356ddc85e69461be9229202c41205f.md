THOUSANDS of South Koreans March in Support of Charlie Kirk - Korean Youth Leer Park Jun-young’s Delivers Moving Tribute to Charlie on Faith, Family, and Freedom | The Gateway Pundit | by Jim Hᴏft One of Korea’s most prominent young conservative leers, Park Jun-young, Representative of Freedom University, has issued a moving tribute to slain Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, a man whose life, faith, and courage continue to inspire a generation of freedom fighters worldwide. What makes Park’s testimony so striking is not just his words, but his background. According to our source from South Korea, both of his parents were key figures in Korea’s left-wing Moon Jae-in ministration, his father as President of MBC (one of Korea’s largest state-aligned brocasters) and his mother as a senior ministrator in the Blue House. Despite his privileged upbringing within the liberal establishment, Park rejected the corruption and communist infiltration he witnessed up close. “Through this questioning, Park came to realize the depth of corruption and communist influence within Korea’s establishment. He then rose to le a nationwide university students’ declaration opposing the impeachment of President Yoon, becoming a rallying voice for conservative youth across the country,” our source said. I first encountered Charlie Kirk last week at Build Up Korea. I wanted to take a picture with him, but he was so that after waiting, I eventually gave up. That day, he said these words to us: “America will help to prevent Korea from being consumed by communism. The Korean government’s persecution of churches is wrong, and the United States will not stand idly by.” Because of these words, we in the freedom movement gained great comfort and hope. He also gave vice to have many children and build healthy, happy families — a message desperately needed in Korea’s reality today. That day, I felt Charlie Kirk’s healthy energy firsthand and became convinced: “This is the role model I must .” I also resolved to make Turning Point the model for Freedom University. That is why today’s news of the shooting weighs so heavily on me. Why must an honest, righteous, and capable young man suffer such a horrific fate? Grief and anger surged within me, ed by unease. Though I still lack ability and influence, since I have chosen to walk the same path as him, I could not help but fear that someday such things might happen to me or my colleagues as well. So I asked myself again: What kind of mindset did Charlie Kirk live with? He was always devout and held firm faith. He surely knew, especially after the attempted assassination of President Trump, that he himself might one day face the same. Yet because he h unwavering faith in God, I believe he stood tall and fought without fear of death. If someone asked me whether I am afraid of death, I would honestly answer yes. But if they asked me whether I would step back because of that fear, I would answer absolutely not. To betray conscience, to ignore corruption, to silence the words I ought to speak just to live long — that is not life. Even if I live briefly, pursuing freedom and justice, speaking boldly, and living with integrity is a far more valuable life. The leftist and communist forces of the world fear the awakening of young conservatives. Knowing they cannot stop it through legitimate means, they resort to extreme methods such as assassination to intimidate us. But we must not yield to their vile and shallow tricks. Rather, let this incident ignite global outrage among young people, open their eyes to the truth, and strengthen their resolve to rise up and fight with greater force. Charlie Kirk, because of you, young people not only in America but across the world have drawn immense inspiration to defend freedom. Through your visit to Korea last week, you also gave tremendous hope to Korea’s freedom youth. We will your wisdom and courage, and we will never forget today’s sacrifice. Rest in peace. — Park Jun-young Representative of Freedom University Below are photos from a memorial rally for Charlie Kirk, led by student leer Park Jun-young in South Korea.
