More left-wing political violence.

The Gateway Pundit | by Cristina Laila More left-wing political violence. A leftist ripped down a North Carolina business owner’s Trump banner and tried to kill him. On September 6, a deranged leftist pulled over his vehicle and ripped down a pro-Trump banner hanging on a sign near one of the business owner’s buses. Mark Thomas, the owner of Pdle Inn Rafting Company, said he saw the suspect on surveillance video rip down the Trump banner, so he went outside and fired his rifle as a warning. “He walked up to the sign. When he stood up at the sign I though ‘I can’t believe this’,” Thomas said told Fox Carolina . “I watched him until he reached up and pulled the sign down. It’s just a shock.” “I let him know that somebody’s watching him and didn’t appreciate it,” Thomas ded. The suspect is then caught on surveillance video sticking a firearm out of the sunroof of a green Jeep Grand Cherokee and firing toward Mark Thomas. The suspect is still on the loose and Swain County Sheriff’s Office is asking for anyone with information to call 828-488-0159 or Swain County Dispatch at 828-488-2196. WATCH:
