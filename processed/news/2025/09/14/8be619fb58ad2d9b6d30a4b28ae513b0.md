Joe Hoft FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Pima County Sheriff’s Deputy Accused of Posting Threats, Calls for Violence Tucson, AZ – A Pima County Sheriff’s Deputy, identified as Ramon Hernández , is facing calls for immediate suspension and investigation after a series of public social media posts surfaced containing violent threats, anti-government rhetoric, and explicit calls for assassination of public officials and U.S. allies. Screenshots of Hernández’s Facebook posts, compiled into a formal report, document repeated calls for the death of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , the President of the United States , and derogatory remarks directed at federal agencies including ICE, FBI, and DHS. Several posts explicitly vocate revolution and violent insurrection. Given Hernández’s role as a sworn deputy with arrest powers and access to law enforcement resources, these public statements raise grave concerns about public safety, potential bias in law enforcement actions, and possible insider-threat risks.

The report calls on the FBI, DHS, and Pima County Sheriff’s Department Internal Affairs to take immediate action. Call to Action Citizens, vocacy groups, and media outlets are urged to review the attached evidence packet and demand transparency and accountability from Pima County authorities.
