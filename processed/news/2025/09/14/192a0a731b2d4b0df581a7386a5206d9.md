by Gregory Lyakhov In the days since Charlie Kirk’s assassination, some on the Left have begun making a grotesque comparison—ning Kirk’s murder to the death of George Floyd. It’s a comparison that reveals not just a lack of moral seriousness, but a deliberate effort to distort reality. To equate a man who empowered millions with a man who terrorized his community is as offensive as it is dishonest. Watch: From Floyd Riots to Kirk’s Murder: Violence Is the Left’s Brand Let’s make one thing clear. George Floyd did not deserve to die the way he did. But that doesn’t erase the facts of who he was. Floyd h a long criminal record , including a violent armed robbery in which he pointed a gun at a woman and her child. He died in police custody with lethal levels of fentanyl in his system, having resisted arrest and collapsed while saying, “I can’t breathe,” before being restrained. Whether or not one believes Derek Chauvin acted justly, it is clear that Floyd’s death came amid chaotic and tragic circumstances. What ed was even worse. Cities across America erupted in months of destruction. Riots left over 30 people de. More than $3 billion in property damage was inflicted on small businesses, churches, and entire neighborhoods. Police stations were burned. Courthouses vandalized. And all of it was rationalized in the name of “justice.” Now contrast that with what’s happened after Charlie Kirk’s death . Kirk was assassinated in bro daylight, in front of thousands, for speaking peacefully on a stage. He was not resisting. He was not under arrest. He h no criminal record. There was no ambiguity. No “gray area.” Charlie Kirk was murdered for his ideas. And yet, what have conservatives done in response? We’ve held prayer vigils, lit candles, written tributes, without a single riot. Not a single act of looting. That’s because Charlie Kirk didn’t build a movement of destruction—he built a movement of purpose. Still, many on the Left have decided to mock his death. Thousands have flooded social media to laugh, post memes, and dig up old video clips in an attempt to claim he “deserved it.” One MSNBC analyst even suggested the shooter might have been a supporter celebrating too loudly. There is no comparison between George Floyd and Charlie Kirk. One was a career criminal whose death triggered mass violence. The other was a faith-driven leer who inspired a generation of young people to engage in politics, respect trition, and debate civilly. Charlie didn’t shut down conversation—he lived for it. Charlie worked 15-hour days and spent his time mentoring kids me, pushing us to dream bigger and fight harder for what we believe. Charlie once told me, “If you want to be successful in this country, you still can be. You’re a winner.” What Charlie said to me captured his essence: a man who not only believed in the potential of young people, but instilled in them the courage and duty to make this country better. To try to erase that by comparing him to George Floyd is hateful. And it’s a stain on anyone who participates in that kind of rhetoric. Let Charlie Kirk’s death be a moment of reflection—not for more division, but for moral clarity.
