Alleged Charlie Kirk Assassin Tyler Robinson Joked About FBI Photo Being His 'Doppelganger' in 20-Person Discord Chats While on the Run | The Gateway Pundit | by Cassandra MacDonald The accused shooter of conservative icon Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, reportedly joked with friends on Discord about an FBI-released photo of the suspect being his “doppelganger” just hours before his arrest. Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA and a prominent voice in conservative politics, was fatally shot in the neck on Wednesday while speaking to thousands at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. The Discord exchanges, in a group with 20 people, began after the FBI released grainy images of a lanky, college-aged man in dark clothing during their manhunt, offering a $100,000 reward for information leing to the killer’s capture. On Thursday afternoon, one of Robinson’s friends tagged him in a post with the FBI photos, writing “wya” (slang for “where you at?”) alongside a skull emoji. Robinson responded almost immediately, claiming the figure in the image was his “doppelganger” trying to “get me in trouble.” “Tyler killed Charlie!!!” another user in the chat wrote, according to a report from the New York Times . Another user exclaimed, “Tyler killed Charlie!!!” while a chat member suggested turning him in for the reward. Robinson replied dismissively, “Only if I get a cut,” using an avatar featuring John Arbuckle from the Garfield comic strip. Friends continued the banter, with one warning, “Whatever you do, don’t go to a McDonald’s anytime soon,” referencing Manhattan CEO killer Luigi Mangione’s arrest at the fast-food chain. Robinson joked about disposing of a “manifesto and exact copy rifle” and mocked the investigation, insisting the shooter was “CLEARLY” from California and questioning the authenticity of “trans” inscriptions reportedly found on the ammunition. Kirk’s assassination occurred during the first stop of his “American Comeback Tour,” with Kirk seated under a pop-up tent at the time. The single bullet was fired from about 200 yards away using an imported .30-06-caliber Mauser bolt-action rifle, which investigators later found wrapped in a towel in a nearby wooded area. Shell casings at the scene were inscribed with messages, including one that re, “Hey fascist! catch!” As The Gateway Pundit ly reported , transgender social media users posting hints of foreknowledge and suspicious out-of-state visitors at Robinson’s home have raised serious concerns about a terror network. A neighbor has reported seeing several people driving vehicles with out-of-state license plates entering and exiting the home approximately two weeks before the shooting. “They did not give off a good vibe,” the neighbor said. ‘WE F-CKING DID IT’: X User Connected to Tyler Robinson’s Alleged Boyfriend Celebrated Charlie Kirk’s Death in the Moments After Shooting At least six people involved with the transgender community have appeared to boast of vance knowledge of the crime. Robinson was arrested on Friday and charged with aggravated murder. He turned himself in to authorities in Southwestern Utah, more than a three-hour drive from the crime scene, after being confronted by his father and speaking with a youth minister about the shooting.
