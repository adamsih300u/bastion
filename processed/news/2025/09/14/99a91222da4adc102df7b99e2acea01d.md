Watch This MSNBC 'Misinformation' Reporter Bend Over Backwards to Obscure Charlie Kirk Assassin's Motives (VIDEO) | The Gateway Pundit | by Mike LaChance MSNBC ‘misinformation’ reporter Brandy Zrozny recently tied herself in knots on television, trying to excuse away the motives for Charlie Kirk’s assassin. The media coverage over the last few days has been awful in general, but this moment deserves some sort of award for blatant dishonesty. Zrozny insists that the messages scrawled on the bullets can’t be understood as a symbol of the shooter’s motive, even going so far as to suggest that the shooter might have put those messages there to assign blame to the left. This is a perfect example of why even NBC no longer wants anything to do with MSNBC, which will soon be rebranded as an independent entity called MSNOW. The Washington Free Beacon reports: MSNBC Misinformation Reporter Suggests Kirk Assassin May Have Engraved ‘Hey Fascist’ on Bullet To ‘Set Up’ the Left MSNBC reporter Brandy Zrozny suggested Friday that Tyler Robinson, the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s assassination, could have been “trying to set up another ideological enemy for the shooting” by leaving anti-fascist references on the ammunition he used in Wednesday’s shooting. Authorities revealed at a press conference Friday morning that a shell casing found with the rifle used to assassinate Kirk was engraved with a message that re, “Hey fascist! Catch!” Scrawled on another shell casing were the lyrics from a prominent Italian anti-fascist folk song… Still, Zrozny, an award-winning misinformation and internet extremism reporter, said it’s “impossible” to decipher why the alleged assassin decided to end Kirk’s life before offering up a number of theories. “It’s really hard to tell when you look at what he put on these shell casings, allegedly,” Zrozny said on MSNBC shortly after Cox announced Robinson’s arrest at a press conference Friday morning. “It’s hard to decipher if he really means them, if he’s trolling, if he’s making fun, if he is trying to set up another ideological enemy for the shooting.” “It’s just impossible to say,” Zrozny said. See the video below: The liberal media is not only spinning the facts about this case, they’re outright lying about it. MSNBC, or MSNOW, or whatever it is, completely deserves to eventually go out of business.
