Alleged Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson appears to have been a member of a bizarre Steam group named “Read This If Your Gay,” a title that eerily mirrors the mocking inscription “If you read this, you are gay LMAO,” which was etched on a bullet casing at the crime scene.

BOMBSHELL: Accused Charlie Kirk Assassin Appears to Have Been in Steam Group Called 'Re This If Your Gay,' Echoing Message on Bullet Casing, Members Urged Encrypted Cover-Up of Chats RIGHT AFTER Shooting | The Gateway Pundit | by Cassandra MacDonald Alleged Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson appears to have been a member of a bizarre Steam group named “Re This If Your Gay,” a title that eerily mirrors the mocking inscription “If you re this, you are gay LMAO,” which was etched on a bullet casing at the crime scene. Steam is a video game platform that lets you play, discuss, and create games on your computer. The group’s profile featured cartoonish imagery, including anime-style characters, underscoring the meme-driven world in which Robinson and his associates seem to have operated. Incredibly, members of the group were issued a frantic warning to switch to encrypted chats just hours after the fatal shooting but before Robinson’s arrest, indicating that they may have h information about the shooter. A cryptic announcement was posted in the group on September 10 at 11:24 PM, mere hours after Kirk’s shooting, but crucially before Robinson’s arrest. This group announced this before Tyler’s arrest. What did they know?

But as details emerge, a web of disturbing connections points to a possible broer conspiracy involving online ricalism, transgender networks, and even hints of foreknowledge among left-wing activists. ding to the chilling narrative are Robinson's own flippant jokes me in Discord chats with 20 other users while he was on the run.

On September 9, an account under the handle "NajraGalvz" posted, "Charlie Kirk is coming to my college tomorrow I rlly hope someone evaporates him literally," ed several hours later by, "Lets just say something big will happen tomorrow," accompanied by a grinning dog image.

H/T @MarcoPolo501c3 @GarrettZxcvi pic.twitter.com/48JWvoxH8K — KanekoaTheGreat (@KanekoaTheGreat) September 13, 2025 A violent transgender cult, known as the "Zizians" or "Ziz Cult," has been linked to multiple murders across states, including the fatal shooting of Border Patrol Agent David Maland in early 2025. The cult, described as a "trans vegan terror cult," is accused of orchestrating violent acts against law enforcement and perceived enemies, with members tied to killings in Vermont, North Carolina, and beyond. The group's leer, Jack LaSota, was arrested in Maryland , and appeared to have me preparations for widespre violence. Robinson's own connections, living with his transitioning boyfriend and embedded in online communities rife with anti-fascist rhetoric, mirror the Zizians' profile. Neighbors reported suspicious out-of-state visitors to Robinson's home in the weeks leing up to the shooting, describing them as giving off a "b vibe," further fueling speculation of external coordination. As the FBI delves into Robinson's Discord history, anti-fascist ties, and these foreshowing posts, one thing is clear: this wasn't just a random act of hatred. It smells a coordinated effort from the rical left, amplified by transgender extremism and online echo chambers. Robinson faces charges including aggravated murder, discharge of a firearm causing serious injury, and obstruction of justice, and could face Utah's death penalty by firing squ if convicted.
