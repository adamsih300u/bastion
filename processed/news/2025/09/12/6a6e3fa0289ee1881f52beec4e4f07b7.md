Steven Crowder Obtains Leaked Utah County Sheriff's Office Internal Docs About Suspected Charlie Kirk Assassin Tyler Robinson | The Gateway Pundit | by Cassandra MacDonald Conservative podcaster Steven Crowder has obtained leaked internal documents from the Utah County Sheriff’s Office regarding suspected Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson. The leak comes one day after Crowder announced that his company has been subpoenaed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) over another leak about the case. The document, a probable cause statement, details the arrest of 22-year-old Robinson, as well as the evidence against him, including engraved anti-fascist messages on bullet casings, a family member’s confession tip, and Discord messages about hiding the weapon. According to the Probable Cause Statement signed by Detective Brian Davis, surveillance footage captured Robinson arriving on campus around 8:29 AM in a gray Dodge Challenger, dressed in a maroon t-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo, and light shoes. He later changed into a long-sleeve black shirt featuring an American flag and eagle design, dark jeans, and white/gray Converse Chuck Taylor shoes with black soles, clothing that matched the sniper’s description. Investigators tracked Robinson climbing onto the rooftop of the Losee Center building around 12:17 PM, positioning himself with a view of the courtyard where Kirk was speaking at his “Prove Me Wrong” event. At approximately 12:22 PM, a single gunshot rang out, striking the 31-year-old Kirk in the neck and causing fatal blood loss as he collapsed onstage. Robinson allegedly fled the rooftop, discarding a Mauser .30-06 bolt-action rifle wrapped in a dark towel in a grassy area east of the building. Shoe impressions from Converse sneakers were found on the rooftop edge, and a palm print was recovered, further linking him to the scene. The documents reveal that Robinson h become “more political in recent years,” with a family member recounting a dinner conversation where he expressed hatred for Kirk, accusing the conservative activist of “spreing hate.” On the evening of September 12, that same family member contacted authorities through a friend, claiming Robinson h confessed or implicated himself in the shooting. Investigators also interviewed Robinson’s roommate, who showed them Discord messages from a contact named “Tyler” discussing retrieving a rifle from a bush, engraving bullets, wrapping the weapon in a towel, and changing outfits to eve detection.

Investigators asked if he would show them the messages on Discord, he opened it and showed several messages to investigators and allowed investigators to take photos of the screen as each message was shown by Robinson’s roommate,” the document states. It continues, “These photos consisted of various messages, including content of messages between the phone contact name ‘Tyler’ with an emoji icon, and Robinson’s roommate’s device. The content of these messages included messages diliated with the contact ‘Tyler’ stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel.” “The messages also refer to engraving bullets, and a mention of a scope and the rifle being unique. Messages from the contact Tyler also mention that he h changed outfits.” “Based on the evidence detailed in this statement, I believe there is probable cause that Tyler Robinson committed the crimes of aggravated murder by shooting Charlie Kirk in a circumstance that put many around him at grave risk of death, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice for moving and hiding the rifle believed to be used in the shooting,” Davis concluded. On Thursday, Crowder announced that the ATF h subpoenaed his company after he received a leaked document from within the agency claiming that a weapon found near the site of Charlie Kirk’s assassination was equipped with cartridges etched with symbols and phrases tied to transgender and Antifa ideology.
