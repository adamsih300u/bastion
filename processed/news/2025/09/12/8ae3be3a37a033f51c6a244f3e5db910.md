Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old charged with assassinating Charlie Kirk, is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Tuesday.

The Gateway Pundit | by Cassandra MacDonald Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old charged with assassinating Charlie Kirk, is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Tuesday. The hearing is currently set to be conducted virtually. “Assuming all goes as planned and we file charges on Tuesday, Mr. Robinson’s first appearance will be Tuesday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. MDT,” according to Christopher Ballard, chief of staff at the public information office at the Utah County attorney’s office, according to a report from CNN . Robinson reportedly confessed to his father, then declared that he would rather kill himself than turn himself in to law enforcement. “His family and a friend helped to deliver him into custody of law enforcement in Washington County,” Utah Governor Spencer Cox said during a press briefing on Friday. According to the Probable Cause Statement signed by Detective Brian Davis, surveillance footage captured Robinson arriving on campus around 8:29 AM in a gray Dodge Challenger, dressed in a maroon t-shirt, light-colored shorts, a black hat with a white logo, and light shoes. He later changed into a long-sleeve black shirt featuring an American flag and eagle design, dark jeans, and white/gray Converse Chuck Taylor shoes with black soles, clothing that matched the sniper’s description. Investigators tracked Robinson as he climbed onto the rooftop of the Losee Center building around 12:17 PM, positioning himself with a view of the courtyard where Kirk was speaking at his “Prove Me Wrong” event. At approximately 12:22 PM, a single gunshot rang out, striking the 31-year-old Kirk in the neck and causing fatal blood loss as he collapsed onstage. Robinson allegedly fled the rooftop, discarding a Mauser .30-06 bolt-action rifle wrapped in a dark towel in a grassy area east of the building. Shoe impressions from Converse sneakers were found on the rooftop edge, and a palm print was recovered, further linking him to the scene. The documents reveal that Robinson h become “more political in recent years,” with a family member recounting a dinner conversation where he expressed hatred for Kirk, accusing the conservative activist of “spreing hate.” On the evening of September 11, that same family member contacted authorities through a friend, claiming Robinson h confessed or implicated himself in the shooting. Investigators also interviewed Robinson’s roommate, who showed them Discord messages from a contact named “Tyler” discussing retrieving a rifle from a bush, engraving bullets, wrapping the weapon in a towel, and changing outfits to eve detection.

Investigators asked if he would show them the messages on Discord, he opened it and showed several messages to investigators and allowed investigators to take photos of the screen as each message was shown by Robinson’s roommate,” the document states. It continues, “These photos consisted of various messages, including content of messages between the phone contact name ‘Tyler’ with an emoji icon, and Robinson’s roommate’s device. The content of these messages included messages affiliated with the contact ‘Tyler’ stating a need to retrieve a rifle from a drop point, leaving the rifle in a bush, messages related to visually watching the area where a rifle was left, and a message referring to having left the rifle wrapped in a towel.” “The messages also refer to engraving bullets, and a mention of a scope and the rifle being unique. Messages from the contact Tyler also mention that he h changed outfits.” “Based on the evidence detailed in this statement, I believe there is probable cause that Tyler Robinson committed the crimes of aggravated murder by shooting Charlie Kirk in a circumstance that put many around him at grave risk of death, felony discharge of a firearm, and obstruction of justice for moving and hiding the rifle believed to be used in the shooting,” Davis concluded. Discord has denied having records of the conversations on its servers. Utah is a death penalty state. If convicted, Robinson will be eligible to face a firing squ.
