Scott Adams, the creator of the famous ‘Dilbert’ comic strip, talked about the murder of Charlie Kirk during his ‘Coffee With Scott Adams’ podcast today and suggested that the Democrat party has to be ‘totally dismantled.’ Citing a tweet from conservative activist Mike Cernovich, Adams pointed out that the Democrat party is supported not just by a small group of progressive billionaires, but also by an endless web of non-profits and various NGOs (non-government organizations).
