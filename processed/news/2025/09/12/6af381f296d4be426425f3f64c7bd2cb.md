"At first, small numbers of men appeared to survey the GHF site.

We also received credible information that Hamas operatives were planning to infiltrate women-only distributions dressed as women."</p> <p>As a result, GHF called off women-only distributions throughout all its distribution sites on Friday. Fay said that the disruption was "not a choice we want to make. It’s a decision forced by Hamas," ding, "It's not just threatening us. They’re threatening their own people. The women of Gaza who are simply trying to feed their children are being intimidated and endangered by the very group that claims to represent them. This is deliberate. This is strategic. And this is cruel," he said.</p> <p>Fay accused Hamas of spreing false information, "telling people that [Secure Distribution Site Three] will be closed week." He said that the organization is not certain whether this means that Hamas plans to attack the site.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-strike-targets-hamas-leership-explosions-reported-qatar"><strong><u>ISRAEL STRIKE TARGETS HAMAS LEERSHIP IN QATAR</u></strong></a></p> <div> <div><div><p><span>A Palestinian woman carries a box as people seek aid supplies from the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), in the central Gaza Strip, Aug. 4, 2025.</span> <span>(Stringer/Reuters)</span></p></div></div> </div> <p>"People are visibly scared," Fay said of the rumors and change in tempo. "They’re asking the same question we are: Why threaten the only operation feeding people at scale in Gaza?"</p> <p>Hamas has attacked GHF sites ly.

Fay says the organization has seen a 15%-20% increase in traffic at its sites over the past few days. "Many have never been to our sites before. They’re unfamiliar with our process, and that unfamiliarity is creating confusion. Not violence, but increased disorder."</p> <div> <div><div><p><span>Gazans walk with boxes of humanitarian aid they received at a distribution center run by the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF).</span> <span>(Ey Baba/AFP via Getty Images)</span></p></div></div> </div> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/apps-products?pid=AppArticleLink"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p> <p>Fay called on international organizations and the United Nations to partner with GHF "so food reaches the people, not Hamas." </p> <p>Currently, according to the U.N.
