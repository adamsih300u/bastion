After Charlie Kirk’s death was announced, a man named Jeremiah Farmer, a transportation driver at Orgill Inc.

Despicable Reactions to the Charlie Kirk Assassination: They Wanted Him De - and They’re Celebrating | The Gateway Pundit | by Antonio Graceffo After Charlie Kirk’s death was announced, a man named Jeremiah Farmer , a transportation driver at Orgill Inc. in Utah, who lists LGBTQ and pronouns in his bio, posted: “We need to find people with better aim.” Clark Kennedy of Queens, New York, d a photo of Kirk slumped in his chair after being hit in the neck by an assassin’s bullet with the , “Bro got a kill cam and everything.” In a separate post, he repeated the phrase “Please be de, please be de, please be de” over and over. Miles Carter-Washington, who works at Boeing Space, Defense, and Intelligence Systems — US Department of War wrote “He got what he deserved.” These are the kinds of posts being documented at a website dedicated to exposing such reactions: https://www.charliesmurderers.com/ . It compiles public s from both well-known figures and ordinary users who are reveling in his death. They hated Charlie Kirk because he spoke the truth and was an outspoken Christian. The left, including media and public figures , revealed their true colors through horrific s about his assassination. Since this information is public, reposting it is not doxxing. The website documenting these posts describes itself as “a lawful data aggregator of publicly available information” created to expose those glorifying political violence. It states: “We firmly denounce all political violence and criminal activity. Our thoughts and prayers are with Charlie Kirk’s family.” It asks: “Is an employee or a student of yours supporting political violence online? Look them up… Say ‘NO’ to political violence,” and invites submissions about anyone celebrating Charlie’s death. Many s targeted Charlie’s support for the Second Amendment. Liberals often counter with personal hypotheticals—“What if your family was shot?” or “What if your daughter was raped?”—or claim my grandparents came illegally, though they did not. But conservatives are guided by principle, not personal circumstance. Even if my grandparents h entered illegally, I would still oppose illegal immigration. If someone I knew were raped, I would still oppose abortion. And h Charlie survived, he would still have defended the Second Amendment. One of the most illogical criticisms came from Alexandra Wilson of Sacramento, who wrote: “Charlie Kirk recently said to a Palestinian that there is no such thing as Palestine. Well now look… there is no such thing called Charlie Kirk.” It is unclear he ever said this, but even if he h, the existence of Palestine is debatable. It lacks a defined territory and population. But does that justify killing him? Other attacks twisted his words or outright lied. Rebecca Allen of Sacramento called him “a racist, xenophobic, transphobic, islamophobic, sexist, white nationalist mouthpiece,” claiming he spre hate. In reality, Charlie cited crime statistics showing some demographics were more ly to commit murder, and that same demographic was dramatically more ly to grow up in a home without a father. He also opposed illegal immigration and presented accurate data regarding the number of illegals and corresponding crimes. On charges of transphobia, Charlie pointed to Scripture. Deuteronomy 22:5 states: “The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.” The Bible also condemns homosexuality. Leviticus 20:13 says: “If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination…” Yet Charlie stressed that all people are me in God’s image, all are loved, and all are welcome in the church, though sinful actions cannot be condoned. He also cited science. The National Institutes of Health explains: “In mammals, primary sex determination is strictly chromosomal… In most cases, the female is XX and the male is XY.” The National Human Genome Re Institute ds: “Humans and most mammals have two sex chromosomes, X and Y. Females have two X chromosomes… males have one X and one Y.” Charlie’s pro-life stance drew particular hatred. Ashley Creekbaum of the New Orleans Fire Department wrote: “I think he should be forced to carry that bullet in his body. That bullet has a right to be there because it’s a gift from God.” Liberals claim anti-abortion laws violate the separation of church and state, but the Constitution contains no such phrase. The principle only means the church does not make laws, Congress does. And opposition to abortion is also grounded in science. The American College of Pediatricians affirms: “The predominance of human biological re confirms that human life begins at conception—fertilization.” For stating these truths, Charlie Kirk was murdered, and many celebrate his death. Ironically, they claim the moral high ground even as they cheer the killing of a conservative pundit whose only “crime” was debating ideas and fostering open discussion.
