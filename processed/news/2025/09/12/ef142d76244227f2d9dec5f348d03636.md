The Biden Justice Department entered office with a pledge to “restore norms.” But for many parents of faith, that promise quickly unraveled into one of the most aggressive federal campaigns against parental rights in modern history.

The Gateway Pundit | by Jenn Baker The Biden Justice Department entered office with a pledge to “restore norms.” But for many parents of faith, that promise quickly unraveled into one of the most aggressive federal campaigns against parental rights in modern history. The case of Shana Gaviola, a California mother, stands as a chilling example of how far the government went and how close America came to losing the fundamental right to raise children free from ideological coercion. The Case Mahmoud v. Taylor In June 2025, the Supreme Court issued a landmark 6–3 decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor, drawing a constitutional line in defense of parental rights. Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, declared that public schools cannot compel children to participate in ideological lessons that conflict with their family’s religious beliefs. The ruling reaffirmed the Free Exercise Clause, stating: “The right of parents to direct the religious upbringing of their children would be an empty promise if it did not those children into the public-school classroom.” This decision sent a clear message: parents, not bureaucrats or prosecutors, have the final say in their children’s moral and religious education. HELP SHANA WITH HER LEGAL BATTLE HERE Pam Bondi’s DOJ Going In A New Direction Just months later, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a powerful memorandum signaling a dramatic shift in federal policy. Her directive emphasized: The fundamental right of parents to direct their children’s education. Zero tolerance for retaliation against parents. The use of 18 U.S.C. § 241 to prosecute conspiracies that violate parental rights. Bondi’s words were unequivocal: “This Department stands with America’s parents.” The Gaviola Case Shows a Prosecutor’s Misconduct Shana Gaviola’s prosecution under the Biden DOJ exemplifies the weaponization of federal power. Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Tierney , who led the case, allegedly engaged in deeply inappropriate conduct. In a late-night encounter at a Fresno restaurant, Tierney approached Gaviola with flirtatious remarks, acknowledged their d neighborhood, and even suggested she take him out for a drink after the case concluded. He later handed her his personal phone to speak with the FBI agent who raided her home, and astonishingly, used the same phone to call her defense attorney—while intoxicated. These actions raise serious ethical and legal concerns, painting a picture of harassment rather than justice. HELP SHANA WITH HER LEGAL BATTLE HERE A Pattern of Intimidation Gaviola’s ordeal wasn’t isolated. During the Biden ministration, parents who voiced concerns at school board meetings were surveilled, labeled as domestic threats, and subjected to federal scrutiny. Faith-based objections were dismissed, and the DOJ appeared to prioritize ideological conformity over constitutional freedoms. Why the Case Must Be Dismissed With the Supreme Court’s ruling, Bondi’s memorandum, and the Trump ministration’s renewed commitment to parental rights, the prosecution of Shana Gaviola stands on unconstitutional ground. The misconduct by Tierney alone would warrant disciplinary action in any legal setting. The U.S. Attorney in California should dismiss the charges and publicly acknowledge the injustice. The Bigger Picture Shana Gaviola’s story is emblematic of a broer struggle. It’s not just about one mother; it’s about every parent who dares to stand up for their children. The Biden DOJ tried to make examples out of families, but the tide is turning. Thanks to the courts, new leership, and a groundswell of parental vocacy, America’s families are reclaiming their rights.
