That's a big deal. And it causes a rift with India," he ded. </p> <p>While Washington has put tariffs on U.S. imports from India, there are carve-outs on items pharmaceuticals and electronics – both of which the U.S. heavily imports from New Delhi. </p> <p>Though despite actions taken by European allies, Trump has not imposed any new sanctions directly on Russia since he re-entered the White House, and is facing mounting criticism for not taking more immediate action against Putin after eight months in office. </p> <div> <div><div><p><span>President Donald Trump, left, speaks to NATO General Secretary Mark Rutte during a North Atlantic Council plenary meeting during the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, on June 25, 2025.</span> <span>(AP Photo Kin Cheung, Pool)</span></p></div></div> </div> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/nato-warns-russia-after-poland-shoots-down-huge-number-drones-violated-its-airspace"><strong>NATO WARNS RUSSIA AFTER POLAND SHOOTS DOWN 'HUGE NUMBER' OF DRONES THAT VIOLATED ITS AIRSPACE</strong></a></p> <p>Less than one month after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/key-takeaways-from-trump-putin-summit-meeting-zelenskyy-might-">Trump met with Putin</a> in what was described as a productive meeting, the Kremlin has "paused" negotiations with Ukraine – which h failed to make any real progress in establishing a ceasefire – and nearly two dozen Russian drones entered Poland earlier this week, prompting a multi-nation NATO response to the threat.</p> <p>"Communication channels exist, they are established, our negotiators have the opportunity to communicate through these channels, but for now, perhaps, we can talk about a pause," Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Friday, according to a Bloomberg report. </p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/nato">NATO</a> allies have been on high alert this week ing the drone attack which Trump h suggested could have been a mistake, but which Poland and Ukraine have fervently rejected as any sort of accident.</p> <div> <div><div><p><span>An infographic shows map of downed Russian drones in Poland that violated its airspace during strikes on Ukraine on Sept. 10, 2025. </span> <span>(Photo by Yasin Demirci/Anolu via Getty Images)</span></p></div></div> </div> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/downlo"><strong>CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</strong></a></p> <p>"We would also wish that the drone attack on Poland was a mistake," Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on X on Friday.
