Infamous liberal author Stephen King is now in full-blown damage control after unleashing a vile, baseless smear against Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in the wake of his shocking assassination.

The Gateway Pundit | by Jim Hᴏft Infamous liberal author Stephen King is now in full-blown damage control after unleashing a vile, baseless smear against Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in the wake of his shocking assassination. After the horrific news broke of Charlie Kirk’s execution-style slaying outside his Phoenix home, allegedly at the hands of a deranged leftist rical, King fired off his tweet a deranged clown from one of his own b novels: “He vocated stoning gays to death. Just sayin’.” No fact-check. No context. Just pure, unulterated blood libel designed to demonize a man who dedicated his life to fighting the woke mob and defending Christian values. The backlash was swift and savage. Senator Ted Cruz slammed King as a “horrible, evil, twisted liar.” He ded, “No, he did not. Your party—which you shamelessly shilled for—sent $100 billion to the Ayatollah… who does routinely murder homosexuals. Why are you so dishonest & filled with hate?” You are a horrible, evil, twisted liar. No, he did not.

Why are you so dishonest & filled with hate? https://t.co/slxhbWBbQ0 — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 12, 2025 Sebastian Gorka demanded King prove his claims. “When? You decrepit liar. Show us when Charlie ever said that. When you can’t, publicly apologize to his widow Erika, and Charlie’s children. But you can’t, can you, because you are a soulless ghoul who believed pouring your perversions into “novels” would help you. It won’t,” Gorka wrote. When? You decrepit liar.

He deleted the post and has begun issuing desperate apologies. “I apologize for saying Charlie Kirk vocated stoning gays. What he actually demonstrated was how some people cherry-pick Biblical passages,” King wrote. Charlie Kirk brought open dialogue for gays in the Republican Party, you clearly are still talking out of your ass. You should do yourself a favor and get off X and reflect about who you are as a person bc what you said and did after he was murdered is a lot more horrifying than… — Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (@RepLuna) September 12, 2025 I have apologized. https://t.co/28bhe8M6R3 — Stephen King (@StephenKing) September 12, 2025 King ded, “The horrible, evil, twisted liar apologizes. This is what I get for reing something on Twitter w/o fact-checking. Won’t happen again.” The horrible, evil, twisted liar apologizes.
