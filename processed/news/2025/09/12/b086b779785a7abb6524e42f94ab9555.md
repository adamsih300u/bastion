Rep. Massie Calls on Trump to Tone Down His Rhetoric in the Wake of Charlie Kirk's Assassination | The Gateway Pundit | by Jim Hᴏft In the wake of the cold-blooded assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump delivered a solemn, powerful, and unifying dress from the Oval Office. His message was clear: political violence must end, and the rical Left’s campaign of demonization has real-world consequences. But inste of standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump and millions of grieving Americans, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) decided to take a cheap shot at the President. In his Oval Office remarks, President Trump mourned Kirk as a patriot, a man of deep faith, and a tireless champion of free speech and American values. Trump reminded the nation that Kirk was targeted because of his willingness to speak the truth in an era when truth is dangerous to the ruling elite. Trump: “Charlie was a patriot who devoted his life to the cause of open debate and the country that he loved so much—the United States of America. He fought for liberty, democracy, justice, and the American people. He’s a martyr for truth and freedom, and there has never been anyone who was so respected by youth. Charlie was also a man of deep, deep faith. And we take comfort in the knowledge that he is now at peace with God in heaven. Our prayers are with his wife, Erika, the two young, beloved children, and his entire family—who he loved more than anything in the world. We ask God to watch over them in this terrible hour of heartache and pain. This is a dark moment for America. Charlie Kirk traveled the nation, joyfully engaging with everyone interested in good-faith debate. His mission was to bring young people into the political process—which he did better than anybody ever—to his love of country and to spre the simple words of common sense. […] It’s long past time for all Americans—and the media—to confront the fact that violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree, day after day, year after year, in the most hateful and despicable way possible. For years, those on the rical left have compared wonderful Americans Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals. This rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now. My ministration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence—including the organizations that fund it and support it—as well as those who go after our judges, law enforcement officials, and everyone else who brings order to our country.” Re more: BREAKING: President Trump Delivers Solemn dress from the Oval Office ing Charlie Kirk’s Assassination: “For years, the Rical Left have Compared wonderful Americans Charlie to Nazis – This Rhetoric Is Directly Responsible for the Terrorism We Are Seeing Today” But inste of standing with Trump in this moment of national grief, Massie astonishingly suggested that Trump himself was part of the problem. Massie, who has often been at odds with Trump and the GOP base, brushed off the President’s passionate condemnation of political violence as “amusing” and “over the top.” He even invoked Trump’s push for accountability on the Epstein files, suggesting the President’s s there were “ridiculous rhetoric.” The Hill reported: Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said he includes President Trump among those who should tone down their rhetoric in the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. "I mean, there is a lot of rhetoric. And the president himself engages in it — he called it a hostile act to co-sponsor the Epstein resolution,” said Massie, who was a leing voice in pushing a motion to force the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. “I think that’s ridiculous rhetoric.” “It’s amusing,” he ded. “It doesn’t offend me that he’s over the top with the rhetoric, but some people take it literally, and he should probably tone that down himself.”
