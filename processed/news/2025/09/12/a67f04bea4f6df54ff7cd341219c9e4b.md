GOD BLESS AMERICA: Tina Peters turns 70 in prison on 9-11, the day after Charlie Kirk is assassinated. Guest post by Martel Maxim. Tina Peters and Charlie Kirk highlight what is going on in America today. Whether one realizes it or not, America is at WAR, and the enemy has infiltrated America deep and wide. In the last few years, we watched in disbelief as that enemy within forged charges against Tina Peters (See https://tinapeters.us/) which landed her in prison for 9 years via a rigged lawfare trial. That silencing was a political assassination in order to silence her.
