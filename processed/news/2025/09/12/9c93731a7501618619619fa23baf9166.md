# FBI running 'same playbook' as Boston Marathon bombing in Kirk killer manhunt, retired agent explains

A retired FBI supervisory special agent said that FBI was running the same playbook as the Boston Marathon bombing in the search for Charlie Kirk&apos;s killer.

That protects the public and the case," Pack said. "Same playbook we used in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/boston">Boston</a>. Show the public what you are certain about to trigger quality tips and hold what is not yet courtroom-rey."</p> <div> <div><div><p><span>Utah Gov.

"But we wanted to make sure through DNA and forensic testing that it was the person and not someone whose wallet h been stolen. So we h to wait for confirmation at least initially."</p> <p>Authorities said Kirk’s killer wore Converse sneakers, which drew widespre attention in surveillance footage.</p> <div> <div><div><p><span>This split image shows Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk speaking moments before his assassination and a still from cellphone video showing a dark-cl figure on a rooftop nearby.</span> <span>(@Doug_Zimmer1/X, Tess Crowley/The Deseret News via AP)</span></p></div></div> </div> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/charlie-kirk"><strong>COMPLETE COVERAGE OF CHARLIE KIRK</strong></a></p> <p>"Footwear alone does not define trecraft," Pack said. "Some offenders choose non-tactical shoes to blend on sidewalks, move quietly, or to misdirect. It could be comfort, availability, or deliberate disguise.
