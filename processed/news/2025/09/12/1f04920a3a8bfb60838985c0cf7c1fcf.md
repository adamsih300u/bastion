Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s administration announced a statewide investigation into educators celebrating Charlie Kirk’s political assassination.

DeSantis ministration Announces Statewide Investigation into Educators Celebrating Charlie Kirk's Murder: "Govern Yourselves Accordingly" | The Gateway Pundit | by Margaret Flavin Florida Governor Ron DeSantis’s ministration announced a statewide investigation into educators celebrating Charlie Kirk’s political assassination. Florida Commissioner of Education Anastasios Kamoutsas sent a letter to superintendents throughout the state warning that the DeSantis ministration will not tolerate such vile behavior. The letter res: TO: School District Superintendents FROM: Anastasios Kamoutsas DATE: September 11, 2025 SUBJECT: Upholding Professional Conduct and Ethical Responsibilities It has been brought to my attention that some Florida educators have posted despicable s on social media regarding the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk. These few are not a reflection of the great, high-quality teachers who make up the vast majority of Florida’s educators. Nevertheless, I will be conducting an investigation of every educator who engages in this vile, sanctionable behavior. This memorandum serves to remind superintendents and their employees that they are held to a higher standard as public servants. Certified educators are also subject to the ethical guidelines established in Rule 6A-10.081, Florida ministrative Code (F.A.C.), Principles of Professional Conduct for the Education Profession in Florida. In dition, pursuant to section (s.) 1012.796, Florida Statutes (F.S.), the Commissioner may find probable cause to sanction an educator’s certificate. Furthermore, s. 1012.795, F.S., authorizes the Education Practices Commission to discipline an educator for violation of Rule 6A- 10.081, F.A.C. Although educators have First Amendment rights, these rights do not extend without limit into their professional duties. An educator’s personal views that are me public may undermine the trust of the students and families that they serve. If an educator’s conduct causes a student or his or her family to feel unwelcome or unwilling to participate in the learning environment, it may be a violation of Rule 6A-10.081, F.A.C. Florida law allows the Commissioner to find probable cause to discipline an educator who, “upon investigation, has been found guilty of personal conduct that seriously reduces that person’s effectiveness as an employee of the district school board.” I expect you to this reminder with all school district employees. Together, we must uphold the highest standards of professionalism and keep Florida’s classrooms places of safety and acemic achievement for every student. Govern yourselves accordingly. Teachers are held to a higher standard as public servants and must ensure their conduct does not undermine the trust of the students and families they serve. We will hold teachers who choose to make disgusting s about the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk accountable.… pic.twitter.com/KzXCCGkvZm — Anastasios Kamoutsas (@StasiKamoutsas) September 11, 2025 Governor DeSantis ded, “Celebrating the assassination of a 31-year-old father of two young kids is disturbing.
