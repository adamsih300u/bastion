Siller explained that this tour will allow people to "make sure they never forget what happened" and to understand the price paid for their freedoms.</p> <p>Siller urged all Americans to join this vital mission of doing good. "Please go to <strong>T2T.org</strong> and donate $11 a month," he implored. "Join us on this mission, join us in this promise."</p> </div> </div>
