Avi Abelow: "A Tragic Loss, A Legacy of Truth: Remembering Charlie Kirk" | The Gateway Pundit | by Collin McMahon Israeli Artist Dudi Shoval painted Charlie Kirk to remember Charlie’s big support for Israel. Wow!!! #Israel #CharlieKirk pic.twitter.com/ciCiJvKMMS — Daniel Ben Yeshayahu (@danielbenyeshay) September 11, 2025 Speaking to Harris Faulkner on Fox News, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paid tribute to murdered patriot Charlie Kirk, while Israeli artist Dudi Shoval painted a giant mural of Charlie Kirk in Tel Aviv. A tribute from Israel by guest contributor Avi Abelow: I’m heartbroken. Charlie Kirk has been murdered. A good man, who led a national revolution to reconnect the generation with Biblical values, faith in God, truth, and unwavering support for Israel, is gone. Even worse than the horror of his murder is the reaction we’re witnessing, celebration. Celebration from the left. Celebration from many Muslims. Celebration that reflects just how deeply sick and morally bankrupt parts of our society have become. But today, on this September 11th, a day that should remind us of the price of ignoring evil, I refuse to stay silent. I refuse to let Charlie’s voice be drowned out by the forces he bravely stood against. I h the zechut (privilege) of meeting Charlie here in Israel several years ago. I was immediately struck by his clarity, courage, and conviction. He didn’t just talk about saving America, he built a movement to do it. Over the last two years, I attended Turning Point USA’s AmFest conference and witnessed with my own eyes the revolution he sparked. As one man, he took on a seemingly impossible mission: bring truth, sanity, and Biblical values back to America’s youth, starting right on the front lines, college campuses, to make America Great Again, and make Americans religious again. And he succeeded. Charlie didn’t just educate. He inspired. He empowered. He reshaped national discourse and influenced elections. He me people think again, speak again, and stand up again, for truth, for faith, for freedom, and unapologetically for Israel. More recently, he grew even bolder in identifying the root of the evil trying to destroy America from within, the “red-green alliance,” the terrifying fusion of rical Marxist leftism with Islamism. One of Charlie’s final tweets said it all: “Islam is the sword the left is using to slit the throat of America.” – Charlie Kirk, Sept. 9 Another powerful truth he d: “The spiritual battle is coming to the West and the enemies are wokeism or Marxism, combining with Islamism to go after what we call the American way of life.” Charlie understood what most refuse to see. He said what most are too afraid to say. And he paid the ultimate price. Today, I pray for his wife Erika and their two precious children. I can’t begin to imagine their pain. I pray for America, because this is not just the loss of a man, but of a frontline warrior in the battle for America’s soul. He was on the path to be a future political leer of America, one whose heart and mouth were aligned to truly help save America. And he is now gone. And yet, on this September 11th, of all days, I fear that, just as America ignored the lessons of 9/11 and allowed the evil of that day to take root and grow inside her own borders, too many will ignore the truths Charlie died proclaiming. His words will be twisted. His message diluted. His memory weaponized to push even more hatred against fellow Americans, Jews, against Israel, and against those who still stand for good. Alrey now, there is a MASSIVE social campaign claiming that the Moss killed Charlie because he was “turning on Israel”. It’s a huge campaign with a tsunami of voices promoting it to turn Charlie’s own supporters against Israel and the Jews. I hope I am wrong. But I am not without hope. Because Charlie’s life proved one thing without question: that one courageous soul can awaken millions. And that truth, even in the face of evil, still has power. Charlie, your mission is not over. It’s now in the hands of those you inspired. Le them all from above, to the throne of God. May your memory be a blessing. And may it also be a wake-up call. Am Yisrael Chai. America—wake up. Avi Abelow is CEO of 12 Tribes films and Pulse of Israel news channel. Speaking to Harris Laulkner on Fox News, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his family were “heartbroken”. Netanyahu’s son Yair h lunch with Cahrlie and his wife, Erica on their 2019 visit to Israel. “We’re shattered first as human beings, because a great human being has been taken from us. He was an extraordinary friend.” Netanyahu recalled that Charlie Kirk “wrote me a letter on May 2nd this year. He said, “One of my greatest joys as a Christian is vocating for Israel and forming alliances to defend Judeo-Christian civilization.” A few weeks before the tragedy yesterday, I called him, and I spoke to him, and I said, “Please come to Israel.” I invited him to Israel, and sly that visit will not take place.” Netanyahu called Charlie Kirk “a defender of our common Judeo-Christian civilization.” “He was unbelievably excited to walk at the footsteps of Jesus here. He valued our bond, the bond between America and Israel. He, you know, he did so many things to defend free speech. He h his truth. He stood up for it. But he said, “You can—you can come and debate me.” He invited that debate. He certainly didn’t invite the violence, the horrible violence that tried to silence him.” Netanyahu called political violence “a worldwide problem”: “The people on the, you know, on the extremes, the Islamists, the rical Islamists and their union with the ultra-progressives, they often speak about human rights. They speak about free speech, but they use violence to try to take down their enemies, whether it’s President Trump, who’s been almost assassinated twice, or, you know, they try to kill me here, too. But they got Charlie Kirk, and it’s just heartbreaking.” I h the privilege of having lunch with Charlie and his wife Erika in Jerusalem when they visited Israel a few years ago. The Charlie I met was so young, yet wise beyond his years. I met someone deeply knowledgeable in history and geopolitics— someone who understood the… pic.twitter.com/DiJJPgzTPn — Yair Netanyahu (@YairNetanyahu) September 10, 2025
