Last month President Trump called for far-left billionaire George Soros and his son, Alex Soros, to be charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) for funding and supporting violent far-left rioters. Soros and his Open Society Foundations have funneled money to and bankrolled many dark money projects and rical left movements to destabilize conservative governments and place rical left globalists in power. He is also the puppet master behind the lawfare against Trump, election interference, and chaos across the country. Notably, the leftist billionaire has funded countless instances of violent riots, including anti-Israel movements, Black Lives Matter, and other leftist projects. Soros-funded Texas Majority PAC (TMP) is also under investigation for illegally funding Texas Democrats who fled the state earlier this month to stop mid-term redistricting, the Gateway Pundit reported . President Trump called for Soros and his son, Alex, who has also been a prominent figure in the Democratic Party, to " be charged with RICO because of their support of Violent Protests, and much more, all throughout the United States of America."
