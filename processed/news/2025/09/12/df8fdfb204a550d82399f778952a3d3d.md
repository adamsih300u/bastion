The robot uses AI-enabled sensors, cameras and self-driving to travel through neighborhoods. Request it with an app or even through a virtual at-home assistant Alexa or <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/companies/google">Google Assistant</a>. The robot then rolls quietly from a central hub to your home, opens its lid and carries away your trash before returning to unlo and recharge. The idea is simple: garbage pickup on your schedule, not the city's.</p> <h2><strong>Autonomous trash pickup for planned communities</strong></h2> <p>HARR-E is designed for planned communities and business parks that alrey use d trash facilities. Once the robot drops off waste at the hub, tritional trucks still handle hauling it to recycling centers or landfills. That means fewer missed pickups, cleaner streets and less frustration when bins overflow before collection day.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/autonomous-robot-muscles-smarts-zero-sick-days"><strong>AUTONOMOUS ROBOT WITH MUSCLES, SMARTS AND ZERO SICK DAYS</strong></a></p> <div> <div><div><p><span>HARR-E robot opens lid during a trash pick-up.</span> <span>(Oshkosh)</span></p></div></div> </div> <h2><strong>Why the HARR-E trash robot matters</strong></h2> <p>The robot isn't just another CES prototype. HARR-E won a CES Picks Award, judged by a panel of industry experts. That recognition signals this isn't just hype, it's a concept serious enough to stand out among thousands of ggets on display in Las Vegas.</p> <p>And it's not just convenient. HARR-E could bring real benefits:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Less noise: </strong>No more 6 a.m. garbage truck wake-ups.</li> <li> <strong>Cleaner streets: </strong>Trash gets collected before it piles up.</li> <li> <strong>On-demand service:</strong> Pickups happen when you choose.</li> <li> <strong>Lower emissions: </strong>Electric operation cuts pollution compared to diesel trucks.</li> </ul> <p>Oshkosh developed the system with its Pratt Miller business unit, known for vanced engineering in robotics and autonomy. That expertise makes the concept far more credible than a flashy demo. As Jay Iyengar, Oshkosh's executive vice president and chief technology officer, put it:</p> <p><i>"</i><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech"><i>Self-driving technology</i></a><i> will play an increasing role in our daily lives. HARR-E is a great example of how autonomous technology can make chores taking out the trash a thing of the past." </i></p> <div> <div><div><p><span>Illustration of the HARR-E trash robot.</span> <span>(Oshkosh)</span></p></div></div> </div> <h2><strong>Smarter AI recycling to reduce waste</strong></h2> <p>Oshkosh is also building <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/tech/topics/smart-and-safe-tech">AI recycling systems</a> that can scan bins and detect items that don't belong. One mistake often ruins an entire lo, sending recyclables straight to landfills. This technology could prevent that waste before it leaves the neighborhood. Combined with everyday habits donating or thrifting inste of tossing items, these improvements could help communities shrink their landfill footprint.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/tech/robots-taking-over-uber-eats-deliveries-your-city-"><strong>ROBOTS ARE TAKING OVER UBER EATS DELIVERIES.
