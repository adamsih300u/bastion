The Gateway Pundit | by Jim Hᴏft The Honorary Secretary of the Oxford Literary and Debating Union Trust (OLDUT), the charity that owns the Oxford Union’s buildings and oversees its charitable responsibilities, has resigned in protest, citing the callous behavior of the Oxford Union’s President-Elect ing the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk in the United States. The Secretary declared he could no longer remain in his role as the Union’s charitable overseer while its incoming leership celebrates political violence and trustees refuse to intervene. After news broke that Kirk h been shot, Oxford Union President-elect George Abaraonye allegedly wrote on Telegram, “Charlie Kirk got shot, let’s f*ing go,” according to The Telegraph . The new President of the Oxford Union, George Abaraonye, celebrated the death of Charlie Kirk. These extreme leftists have no humanity. I’m gl he’s being named and shamed. Utterly vile and morally repugnant. pic.twitter.com/b0V43xQHI1 — Lee Harris (@dicted2newz) September 11, 2025 The now-former Honorary Secretary did not mince words in his resignation letter, describing the President-Elect’s behavior as psychopathic and beyond shame, accusing him of glorifying political assassination and using the Union’s platform to enhance his personal brand through reckless attacks on institutions. He warned that the Oxford Union is no longer experiencing isolated scandals but a parigm shift, a weaponization of the Union itself against free speech, open debate, and Western democratic values. The resigning officer, who also appears regularly in the media, cited concerns for his family’s safety after the President-Elect’s rhetoric, noting that his wife fears they may face violence as a result. The letter res: “I write to you today regarding the behaviour of the Oxford Union’s President-Elect regarding the evil assassination of Charlie Kirk in the United States. I am afraid that I do not see this as just another scandal that we need to encourage the Union to handle. I see this as existential. OLDUT’s delegate is about to be run by someone who gloried in the political assassination of a man whom he h debated in the Oxford Union chamber just months ago. And inste of apologising, the President-Elect has doubled down, listing all the reasons why Mr Kirk was a terrible person with views so abhorrent that his murder was merely ‘ironic’. This is a psychopathic response from someone who has no intention of/or perhaps ability to, feel shame. He will, many recent Presidents, deliberately truce and ruin the reputation of the Oxford Union to enhance his personal brand, one that involves attacking institutions the one we are supposed to protect. This is actively different to the scandals of generations; then scandal was a bug or side effect. Now, it is the whole point. Mr Abaraonye will not be the last to try this. This cannot be business as usual, and trustees need to understand the fundamental parigm shift that has happened in the Union, the university, and the country. These people do not care about the Union; they never will. They do not care about free expression or open debate; they merely wear our precious freedoms as a costume until they can use them to attack that which is sacred to us. As it appears OLDUT is unwilling to act, I cannot in good conscience remain as the honorary secretary. This is also personal to me; in a much smaller way I appear in the media talking about politics, and I alrey have a wife who is concerned that she or I will suffer violence as a result. I thereby resign as the Honorary Secretary of the Oxford Literary and Debating Union Trust. I hope this helps spur the wonderful trustees to realise the dangers we face. I am so sorry to leave you in the lurch, and will of course hand over all of the various physical and digital documents, and conduct whatever handovers are necessary in good faith and to the best of my ability. I will finish with the words of the President-Elect, whom it seems vocated for violent retaliation in our very chamber, feet away from where he h debated Charlie Kirk. This is the measure of the man we are not going to prevent from becoming President. “At times, there is simply nothing else that can be required except for violent retaliation. And this is a view I wholeheartedly agree with; the view that some institutions are too broken, too oppressive to be reformed, cancers of our society. And they must, and they should be taken down by any means necessary.”” I have resigned as the honorary secretary of the Oxford Literary Debating & Union Trust, the charity that owns the @OxfordUnion ’s buildings, and dispenses its charitable responsibilities onto the Union as its delegate. The callousness of the Union’s President-Elect has shocked… pic.twitter.com/lcyHq45rCU — James Price (@jamespriceglos) September 12, 2025 English Conservative politician and a member of the House of Lords, Lord Moyland, also weighed in, stating, I’m an old President of the Oxford Union and I think he should resign now.” I’m an old President of the @OxfordUnion and I think he should resign now. https://t.co/V7zCQQG2Yq — Lord Moylan (@danielmgmoylan) September 11, 2025 The Oxford Union has since issued a statement condemning the remarks me by the president-elect. “The Oxford Union would to unequivocally condemn the reported words and sentiments expressed by the President-Elect, George Abaraonye, with regards to the passing of Charlie Kirk. His reported views do not represent the Oxford Union’s current leership or committee’s view. The current ministration has, under President Moosa Harraj, no association with, and is entirely independent from, Mr Abaraonye’s ministration. In alignment with the statement published by our Society earlier today, we reaffirm our stance that the Oxford Union firmly opposes all forms of political violence and strongly stands by our commitment to free speech and considerate debate. We would to reiterate that our condolences lie with Charlie Kirk’s family, especially his wife and young children, who are enduring such terrible grief.” pic.twitter.com/zlagxKTC74 — Oxford Union (@OxfordUnion) September 11, 2025 However, Oxford University has confirmed that it will not be taking any action against George Abaraonye. “Though Mr Abaraonye’s s are abhorrent, they do not contravene the College’s policies on free speech, or any other relevant policy. Therefore, no disciplinary action will be taken.” Oxford University has confirmed it will take no action against Union President-elect George Abaraonye. He openly cheered Charlie Kirk’s murder, and this cowardly response is every bit as revolting. The Left have no shame, and this will only fuel worse rhetoric. pic.twitter.com/8gnh6ONabY — Nicholas Lissack (@NicholasLissack) September 12, 2025 Here’s a clip of George Abaraonye, the incoming president of the Oxford Union, openly promoting political violence. “They should – and they must – be taken down, by any means necessary. They are cancers in society!” George Abaraonye, the new president of @OxfordUnion , flagrantly promotes political violence. It comes after he celebrated Charlie Kirk’s execution. pic.twitter.com/ivJjfWS7hs — Peter Lloyd (@Suffragent_) September 12, 2025 Here’s a video of Abaraonye debating Charlie Kirk on “toxic masculinity” at the Oxford Union in May while just wearing joggers, slippers and a t-shirt.
