We reached out weeks ago to all major parties to ensure that the Jewish community would hear from high-ranking figures with relevant portfolios at a time when antisemitism in Britain is at its highest levels in living memory. The opposition and Reform UK understood the importance of this moment and responded accordingly by sending senior officials, the Government did not."</p> <p>The spokesperson for the campaign against antisemitism ded, "Inste, Labour dragged its feet and at the last moment offered a backbench peer, which could hardly be said to represent the government, let alone carry the authority of a senior minister. That fell far short of what was required and expected. The decision not to send a proper representative was scandalous, and it will do nothing to reassure British Jews that this government has their back or even recognizes the scale of the crisis."</p> <p>Britain’s Chief Rabbi Sir Efraim Mirvis told the protestors: "These are awful times. We have seen an explosion of hatred right across the UK. Antisemitism is rife right across the UK. You will see it. You will hear it. You will feel it.
