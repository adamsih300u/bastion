We want to show that it doesn’t matter what you do. We are not afraid," McKinley told Fox News Digital. </p> <p>Though they never entered the venue, the Shinkles positioned themselves as vocal supporters of Kirk’s free-speech agenda and tritional values message.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-department-warns-revoke-visas-foreigners-who-glorify-violence-after-kirk-shooting"><strong>STATE DEPARTMENT WARNS IT WILL REVOKE VISAS OF FOREIGNERS WHO 'GLORIFY VIOLENCE' AFTER KIRK SHOOTING</strong></a></p> <div> <div><div><p><span>Two cousins, Anthony and McKinley Shinkle, both college students, described their experience around the rally where Charlie Kirk was assassinated and how they are honoring his memory. </span> <span>(Fox News Digital/Peter D'Abrosca)</span></p></div></div> </div> <p>"You can’t silence people.

"If they’re willing to kill him, they will kill any of us."</p> <p>By holding signs that re, "Charlie Kirk, American Hero" and "We Are Not Afraid," the Shinkles sought to turn the violence into a rallying cry rather than a deterrent.</p> <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/person-interest-charlie-kirk-assassination-pictured-photos-released-fbi"><strong>PERSON OF INTEREST IN CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSINATION PICTURED IN PHOTOS RELEASED BY FBI</strong></a></p> <div> <div><div><p><span>Charlie Kirk hands out hats before speaking at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah, Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025.</span> <span>(Tess Crowley/The Deseret News via AP)</span></p></div></div> </div> <p>Students who attended the campus event at <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/west/utah">Utah Valley University</a> on Wednesday described a mix of miration for America’s trition of free speech and horror at how quickly violence shattered it.</p> <p>One international student said she h looked forward to attending the event. </p> <p>"It’s actually a cool thing about America that you get to do that, debate peacefully, and then everybody gets to their opinions," Laura Lo said.</p> <p>But that optimism turned to terror within minutes.</p> <p>"When I heard it, I thought it was a firecracker," Lo said.
