"I was very inspired by the family setup there. The children were just young and sweet, and they were very excited to be here in the country for the first time.</p> <p>"They h only just come. I don't think that they were even speaking English at that point. They h, literally, just arrived. But they were just excited, and they were just having a lot of fun with the pictures, just being kind of silly and cute. I do remember Iryna. She was very sweet and polite and just happy and just very fun-loving. I picked up on the natural joy that they h as a family." </p> <p>"Now it's heartbreaking and so s I can't even really find words to express," she ded.

Make her real," one neighbor said.</p> <p>For her neighbors, the flowers she left behind are more than art — they are a reminder of the young woman who dreamed of building a new life in America.</p> <p>During a moving part of Tuesday’s news conference, Ferguson d a message from Zarutska’s family. </p> <p>"After Iryna's death, the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/ukraine">embassy in Ukraine</a> called and said, ‘We’ll help you bring her home.’ But her family said no. They told us she loved America, and they wanted to bury her here. So I think we can give her an America to be proud of." </p> <p><i>Fox News Digital's Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report. </i></p> <div><div> <p>Peter D'Abrosca joined Fox News Digital in 2025. ly, he was a politics reporter at The Tennessee Star. </p> <p>He grew up in Rhode Island and is a gruate of Elon University. </p> <p> Peter on X at <a href="https://x.com/pmd_reports">@pmd_reports</a>.
