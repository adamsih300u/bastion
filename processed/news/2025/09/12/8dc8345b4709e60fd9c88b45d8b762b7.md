Alleged Charlie Kirk Assassin Tyler Robinson's Stellar ACT Scores Revealed - Posted by Proud Mother on Facebook Before Tragedy | The Gateway Pundit | by Cassandra MacDonald New details have emerged about the suspect in the assassination of conservative icon Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson. Moments after his name was announced, Facebook accounts believed to belong to Robinson’s parents were uncovered. Among the posts on his mother, Amber Jones Robinson’s, Facebook account were the accused assassin’s impressive ACT scores from March 2020. The ACT Student Report, bearing Robinson’s full name, Tyler J. Robinson, and his ACT ID (74549413), paints a picture of a highly intelligent young man who excelled acemically in high school. Scoring a near-perfect composite of 34 out of 36, Robinson demonstrated exceptional aptitude across multiple subjects. His breakdown includes: Math: 34 Science: 32 STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math combined): 33 English: 34 Reing: 36 His writing score was listed as N/A, with no English Language Arts (ELA) composite provided, though the report includes a “+” indicator to ELA, suggesting potential strength in that area. These scores placed Robinson in the elite percentiles nationally, with a 99% US rank in composite, math, science, STEM, and English, and a perfect 100% in reing. Diving deeper into the subscores, Robinson’s math performance was particularly strong in areas preparing for higher math (92%), algebra (98%), functions (100%), geometry (75%), statistics and probability (100%), integrating essential skills (96%), and modeling (95%). In science, he scored 89% in interpretation of data, 100% in scientific investigation, 100% in evaluation of models, inferences, and experimental results. English subscores showed 92% in production of writing, 100% in knowledge of language, 90% in conventions of standard English. Reing was flawless across the board: 100% in key ideas and details, 100% in craft and structure, 100% in integration of knowledge and ideas. This man h every opportunity to have a bright future, so what went wrong? Robinson’s mother has since locked or deleted her Facebook account, but the Gateway Pundit was able to view it while it was live. Surveillance footage from after the assassination captured a figure, now believed to be Robinson, positioned on a rooftop approximately 200 yards from the outdoor stage where Kirk was speaking. The assailant fired a single, precise shot using an imported Mauser .30-06 bolt-action rifle, striking Kirk during his “Prove Me Wrong” debate event attended by thousands of students. After the shot, the suspect climbed down from the roof, discarded the rifle wrapped in a towel in a nearby wooded area, and fled into a surrounding neighborhood. Investigators recovered the weapon, along with a palm print and footwear impressions, which aided in tracking the perpetrator. Robinson, described by officials as a college-aged male who “blended in” with the university community, appeared to have h familiarity with the campus layout, suggesting possible prior reconnaissance. He is depicted in released images as a slim, young man with dark hair, wearing a black long-sleeved T-shirt, a baseball cap, sunglasses, and Converse sneakers, clothing that authorities highlighted as distinctive during the initial . His proficiency with the high-powered rifle indicates some level of training or experience, though no specific background in firearms has been publicly disclosed. This is a developing story and The Gateway Pundit will be continuing to provide information as it becomes available.
