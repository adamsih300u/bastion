- `author` - Author name
- `tags` - Array of tags for organization
- `status` - Document status (draft, published, etc.)
- Custom fields - Any additional metadata you need

**Creative Writing Types:**
- `type: fiction` - Enables **Fiction Editing Agent** for prose creation/editing

  - Works with active fiction editor
  - Example: "Write chapter 3", "Edit this scene to add tension"
  
- `type: outline` - Enables **Outline Editing Agent** for story structure
  - Creates and refines story outlines
  - Expands structure and organization
  - Example: "Create a three-act outline", "Expand this outline"
  
- `type: character` - Enables **Character Development Agent** for character profiles

  - Example: "Define magic system rules", "Create world-building rules"
  
- `type: style` - Style guide for proofreading and consistency
  - Used by **Proofreading Agent** for grammar/spelling/style corrections
  - Aligns corrections to your style guide
  - Example: "Proofread this", "Check grammar"

**Content Creation Types:**
- `type: substack` or `type: blog` - Enables **Substack Agent** for article/tweet generation
  - Generates long-form articles OR tweet-sized posts
  - Has built-in research capabilities
  - Example: "Write article about X", "Create post", "Generate tweet"
  
- `type: podcast` - Enables **Podcast Script Agent** for TTS-ready scripts
  - Generates podcast scripts with audio cues
  - Optimized for text-to-speech
  - Example: "Create podcast episode", "Generate script"

**Technical Types:**

- `type: project` - Enables **General Project Agent** for project planning, design, and documentation
  - Handles HVAC, landscaping, gardening, home improvement, and more
  - Project planning and requirements gathering
  - Scope definition and timeline planning
  - Design assistance and approach recommendations
  - Tradeoff analysis and decision documentation
  - Project file organization and maintenance
  - Automatically updates project files based on your input

- `type: sysml` - Enables **SysML Agent** for system diagrams and UML
  - System modeling and diagram generation
  - UML diagram creation
  - Example: "Create a system diagram", "Generate UML for [system]"

**Reference Types:**
- `type: reference` - Enables **Reference Agent** for personal reference documents
  - Analyzes journals, logs, records, tracking documents
  - Read-only analysis and pattern detection
  - Provides insights and answers questions about reference data
  - Example: "What patterns do you see in my food log?", "Analyze my journal entries"

**How Editor-Based Agents Work:**
1. When you open a document with a `type` in frontmatter, that type determines which agent handles your requests
2. The agent uses the document as project context automatically
3. Editor agents can read referenced files (via frontmatter `components`, `characters`, `rules`, etc.)
4. Agents maintain project structure and update files based on your input
5. Some agents (electronics, project) create and organize multiple project files automatically

**Example Frontmatter for Different Types:**

Fiction:
```yaml
---
type: fiction
title: The Adventure Begins
author: Your Name
status: draft
---
```

Electronics Project:
```yaml
---
type: electronics
title: Smart Home Controller
components:
  - ./sensor_specs.md
  - ./power_supply.md
---
```

Project Planning:
```yaml
---
type: project
title: Home Renovation
status: planning
---
```

When you have a document open with a matching type, agents automatically use it as project context!

**ORG-MODE TASKS (Manage TODO items)**
Commands:
- "Add TODO: [task description]" - Creates a new task
- "Show my TODO list" - Lists all tasks
- "Mark task [number] as done" - Completes a task
- "What's tagged @work?" - Search tasks by tag

**KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS**
Global hotkeys (work anywhere in the app):
