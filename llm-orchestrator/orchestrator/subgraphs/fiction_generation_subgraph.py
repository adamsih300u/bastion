"""
Generation Subgraph for Fiction Editing

Reusable subgraph that handles:
- Context assembly (manuscript chapters, references, outlines)
- Prompt construction (system prompt + user message)
- LLM generation calls with structured output
- Output validation (outline copying detection, Pydantic validation)

Used by fiction_editing_agent for edit plan generation.
